          "description": "Every complex modern device needs non-volatile storage to keep program and configuration data while unpowered. There are several competing options on the market available to today’s systems designers: serial Flash, raw NAND chips, (micro)SD, and Embedded MultiMediaCard (eMMC). eMMC is the topic of this discussion, and specifically how to interact with it without removing the chip from the system.\nSuch an approach is often desirable – after all, even when you are exceptionally skilled with BGA re-balling, there are only so many heating and cooling cycles the chip and the PCB can withstand before the probability of a failure gets too high. That is not to mention the exceptionally fine pitch of the most often encountered packages used by eMMC. The contact balls/pads are just 0.5mm (0.02in) ap…",

This post examines how JSON, XML, and YAML parsers in Go handle edge cases in ways that have repeatedly resulted in high-impact security issues in production systems. We explore three real-world attack scenarios: marshaling/unmarshaling unexpected data, exploiting parser differentials, and leveraging data format confusion. Through examples, we demonstrate how attackers can bypass authentication, circumvent authorization controls, and exfiltrate sensitive data by exploiting these parser behaviors.",

          "description": "Recently, leading AI companies announced support for remote MCP, allowing an MCP client to connect to a remote MCP server via Streamable HTTP, which still supports Server-Sent Events (SSE). The Streamable Data Input/Output (SDIO) protocol remains essential for local integrations and remote services, which are accessible only through conventional APIs. In my opinion, the excitement surrounding new model releases has lost its significance. AI model developers seem to primarily focus on optimizing their models for AI benchmarks. However, the genuine innovations occur in the technologies surrounding AI models—most notably in AI agents and the supporting infrastructure in which remote MCP servers will play an important role.\nSource",

While this technology is just a thin wrapper around a separate account, there are a few nuances such as who is permitted to access these accounts, as well as existing UAC bypasses which are still effective against the new \"backdoorless\" Administrator Protection. This post explores these nuances in detail.",

Today, we introduce a BOF linting tool to address some of the common pitfalls.\nBOFs are lightweight, in-memory modules used in Cobalt Strike and other post-exploitation/C2 frameworks such as Outflank C2 and Core Impact.  They are object files produced by a C compiler (COFF). Cobalt Strike parses this file and acts as a linker and loader for its contents. This approach allows you to write code for use in Beacon, without tedious gymnastics to manage strings and dynamically call Win32 APIs.\nBOFs are powerful and flexible, but their minimalistic design inherently comes with strict constraints.\n\nRead full post\nThe post BOF Linting for Accelerated Development appeared first on Outflank.",

The first part discussed the basics of how enclaves work, provided some ideas on how to develop your own enclave, as well as analyze and debug existing enclaves. We also hinted at how enclaves could potentially be used for offensive purposes. Remember: VTL0 is where the normal kernel lives, VTL1 is where the secure kernel operates (and our enclaves).\nIn this follow-up post, we will share what we discovered while digging into enclave internals. It’s been a hands-on journey filled with many (failed) experiments. We’ll walk you through some of the practical techniques we used to exploit a read-write primitive in a vulnerable enclave DLL, and how we managed to turn that into VTL1 code execution.\n\n\n\nThe outcome of this research has been integrated into Outflank C2 (part of our OST offering) for implant sleepmasking.\n\nRead full post\nThe post Secure Enclaves for Offensive Operations (Part II) appeared first on Outflank.",
