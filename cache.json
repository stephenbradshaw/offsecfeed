TAG’s blog post covers the targeting and the actor behind the campaign. This is a technical analysis of the final stage of one of the exploit chains, specifically CVE-2023-0266 (a 0-day in the ALSA compatibility layer) and CVE-2023-26083 (a 0-day in the Mali GPU driver) as well as the techniques used by the attacker to gain kernel arbitrary read/write access.\n\nNotably, all of the previous stages of the exploit chain used n-day vulnerabilities:\n\n\nCVE-2022-4262, a vulnerability patched in Chrome that was unpatched in the Samsung browser (i.e. a \"Chrome n-day\"), was used to achieve RCE.\n\n\nCVE-2022-3038, another Chrome n-…",

The Kubernetes metrics server is a cluster addon that collects and aggregates resource metrics from kubelets (agents that run on each cluster node) and exposes these metrics in the Kubernetes API server. The metrics server is a scalable, efficient solution for collecting resource metrics in Kubernetes.

          "description": "For avoiding EDR userland hooks, there are many ways to cook an egg:\nDirect system calls (syscalls), Indirect syscalls, unhooking, hardware breakpoints, and bringing and loading your own version of a library. These methods each have advantages and disadvantages. When developing a C2 implant it’s nice to work with a combination of multiple of these. For instance, you could use a strong (in)direct syscall library for direct usermode to kernel transition, then use unhooking or hardware breakpoints for user mode-only (to bypass AMSI, ETW e.g.) functions.\nRegarding system calls, excellent research has already been done. A small selection of relevant blog posts is Klezvirus’ post on syswhispers, MDSec’s post on direct invocation of system calls and our own blog post on combining direct system calls srdi.\nSo,\nTags: BOF, detect hooks, LoadLibrary, OPSEC safe, OST, syscalls, Unhooking\nRead full post\nThe post Solving The “Unhooking” Problem appeared first on Outflank.",
