As an incredibly reductive summary: fuzzing is an automated, random testing process which tries to explore the state space (e.g., different interpretations of the input or behaviour) of a program under test (PUT; sometimes also SUT, DUT, etc.). Fuzzing is often celebrated as one of the most effective ways to find bugs in programs due to its inherently random nature, which defies human expectation or bias1. The strategy has found countless security-critical bugs (think tens or hundreds of thousands) over its 30-odd-years of existence, and yet faces regular suspicion from industry and academia alike. Mostly. Fuzzers can be overfit to certain applications, intentionally or not. &#8617;",

SameSite helps mitigate CSRF, but does that mean CSRF is dead?\nWhile auditing major web applications, we realized that Client Side Path-Traversal (CSPT) can be actually leveraged to resuscitate CSRF for the joy of all pentesters.\nThis blog post is a brief introduction to my research.

Although most security professionals may not be surprised by this lack of coverage, one should not overlook these platforms. For example, developers using macOS often have privileged cloud accounts or access to intellectual property like source code. Linux servers may host sensitive databases or customer-facing applications. Defenders must have confidence in their tools for these systems, and attackers must understand how to evade them. This post dives into endpoint security products on macOS and Linux to understand their capabilities and identify weaknesses.\n\nEndpoint detection and response (EDR) agents comprise multiple sensors: components that collect events from one or more telemetry sources. The agent formats raw telemetry data into a standard format and then forwards it to a log aggregator.\nTags: EDR, Linux, macOS\nRead full post\nThe post EDR Internals for macOS and Linux appeared first on Outflank.",
