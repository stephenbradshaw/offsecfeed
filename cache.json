When reading through some of the features of the Rubeus tool I realised that there was a possible way of abusing Kerberos to bypass UAC, well on domain joined systems at least. It's unclear if this has been documented before, this post seems to discuss something similar but relies on doing the UAC bypass from another system, but what I'm going to describe works locally. Even if it has been described as a technique before I'm not sure it's been documented how it works under the hood.\nThe Background!\nLet's start with how the system prevents you bypassing the most pointless security feature ever.

One type of memory corruption that is very hard to prevent is the use-after-free and the reason is that it has too many faces! Since it cannot be associated with any specific pattern in source code, it is not trivial to eliminate this vulnerability class. In this blog, a use-after-free vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox will be explained which has been assigned CVE-2022-26381.
