OpenAI is now deploying connectors for Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, and GitHub across Europe for all plans—notably after Anthropic released their MCP connectors weeks ago in Europe without such concerns, suggesting OpenAI's initial data protection claims were merely pretextual or that MCP has no priority status for the AI company. The announcement mentions Google Contacts, but this connector isn't yet accessible in my ChatGPT with a Plus plan.

However, shifting Copilot from the sidebar to the center in Edge is more than just a design update.

But the upcoming battles aren’t just about who controls the web’s entry point—it could signal the beginning of the end of the web as we know it. The fall of Google’s dominance as the web’s central policymaker now seems inevitable.

          "description": "This post complements the presentation I gave at Black Hat USA 2025.\nCan a small, self-hosted LLM outperform state-of-the-art models at evasive malware development?\nIn this technical deep dive, we explore how reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) enables training compact specialist models that rival large generalists in domain-specific tasks.\nIn the first half of this post, we’ll break down the LLM training process and recent opportunities created by RLVR. The second half details our training methodology for Dante-7B, a 7 billion parameter model that generates functional, evasive Cobalt Strike shellcode loaders capable of bypassing Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE). We’ve released Dante-7B on Hugging Face, complete with a demo app so anyone can experiment with the model.\n\nIntroduction\nThe best models from OpenAI,\nTags: AI\nRead full post\nThe post Training Specialist Models: Automating Malware Development appeared first on Outflank.",
