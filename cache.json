          "description": "The Tesla Wall Connector is a Level 2 electric vehicle charge station designed for use by residential home users. The device has a minimal user interface in its hardware, providing a Wi-Fi based interface for configuration and an NFC reader for user authentication. The device does not come with a dedicated mobile application out of the box; the initial configuration—which is rather minimal—is performed via the web interface. After that, the device suggests the Tesla One app is to be used for further configuration. The Tesla app allows connecting to the device but apparently can only be used to perform a few functions such as scheduled charging and viewing information about the device. It does not offer options for further configuration.\nAt the moment of writing, the latest software version…",

As the use of archive file formats is widespread in software development, it is crucial for developers to understand the potential security risks involved in handling these files.\nThe objective of my research was to identify, analyze, and detect vulnerable implementations in several popular programming languages used for web and app development, including Python, Ruby, Swift, Java, PHP, and JavaScript. These languages have libraries for archive decompression that, when used improperly, may potentially lead to vulnerabilities.\nTo demonstrate the risk of unsafe unpacking, I created proof-of-concept (PoC) code with different vulnerable impleme…",

Updates frequently highlight new features being added, design changes that occur and potential areas that might benefit from more security scrutiny.\nA few months back I noticed an interesting update to the M365 Copilot (BizChat) system prompt. In particular, there used to be one enterprise_search tool in the past. You might remember that tool was used during the Copirate ASCII Smuggling exploit to search for MFA codes in the user’s inbox.",
