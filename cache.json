          "description": "Vulnerabilities and exploits in common targets like browsers are often associated with memory safety issues. Typically this involves either a direct error in memory management or a way to corrupt internal object state in the JavaScript engine. One way to eliminate such memory safety issues is to use a memory-safe language such as Rust or even JavaScript itself. At Pwn2Own Vancouver 2022, Manfred Paul compromised the Mozilla Firefox browser using a full chain exploit that broke the mold. Although his exploit used some memory corruptions, the vulnerable code was written in a memory-safe programming language: JavaScript! In fact, both vulnerabilities used in the chain were related to one rather notorious language aspect of JavaScript – prototypes. In this blog, we will look at the first vulne…",

          "description": "Today at the Black Hat USA conference, we announced some new disclosure timelines. Our standard 120-day disclosure timeline for most vulnerabilities remains, but for bug reports that result from faulty or incomplete patches, we will use a shorter timeline. Moving forward, the ZDI will adopt a tiered approach based on the severity of the bug and the efficacy of the original fix. The first tier will be a 30-day timeframe for most Critical-rated cases where exploitation is detected or expected. The second level will be a 60-day interval for Critical- and High-severity bugs where the patch offers some protections. Finally, there will be a 90-day period for other severities where no imminent exploitation is expected. As with our normal timelines, extensions will be limited and granted on a case…",

Some were also found to be exploited in the wild. Since these bugs were found in ESXi’s implementation of the SLP service, VMware provided workarounds to turn off the service. VMware also disabled the service by default starting with ESX 7.0 Update 2c. In this blog post, we explore another remotely reachable attack surface: ESXi’s TCP/IP stack implemented as a VMkernel module. The most interesting outcome of this analysis is that ESXi’s TCP/IP stack is based on FreeBSD 8.2 and does not include security patches for the vulnerabilities disclosed over the years since that release of FreeBSD. \nThis result also prompted us to analyze the nature of vulnerabilities di…",

          "description": "This blog post will first give a brief overview of obfuscation based on Mixed-Boolean-Arithmetic (MBA), how it has historically been attacked and what are the known limitations. The main focus will then shift to an extension of the oracle-based synthesis approach, detailing how combining program synthesis with the equality saturation technique produces significantly more simplification opportunities. Finally, a set of examples spanning from different MBA categories over unsolved limitations up to future work ideas will hopefully serve as food for thoughts to the reader. Across the post, references to existing research are provided to delve into additional details and deepen the understanding of the topics.",
