My introductory article about Cline mentioned that the VS Code extension supports MCP. You will see that installing an MCP server is easier with the assistance of an AI. In this post, I will explain how to install AWS MCP, an MCP server that allows you to manage AWS resources with the help of an AI. If you don't want to be left behind, I highly recommend getting started with learning how to use AI to get your job done. This tech revolution is advancing faster than any before it.
