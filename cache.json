When reading through some of the features of the Rubeus tool I realised that there was a possible way of abusing Kerberos to bypass UAC, well on domain joined systems at least. It's unclear if this has been documented before, this post seems to discuss something similar but relies on doing the UAC bypass from another system, but what I'm going to describe works locally. Even if it has been described as a technique before I'm not sure it's been documented how it works under the hood.\nThe Background!\nLet's start with how the system prevents you bypassing the most pointless security feature ever.

One type of memory corruption that is very hard to prevent is the use-after-free and the reason is that it has too many faces! Since it cannot be associated with any specific pattern in source code, it is not trivial to eliminate this vulnerability class. In this blog, a use-after-free vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox will be explained which has been assigned CVE-2022-26381.

The testing is being done against a small WebSockets based app I wrote called SocketToMe which has a few published services along with a few unpublished ones. In this article we are going to look at one of the published ones and try to identify some of the unpublished ones. The first feature I'll investigate is the number guessing game. Here the system picks a random number between 1 and 100 and you have to guess it. I'm going to cheat and see if I can get ZAP to play all 100 numbers for me to go for a quick win.",

          "description": "Three times in the past few months I've been asked by clients to retest previous findings to see if they have been successfully fixed. One of the reports I was given was one I'd written, the other two were by other testers.\n\nFor my report I couldn't remember anything about the test, reading the report gave me some clues but I was really lucky and found that I'd left myself a test harness in the client's folder fully set up to test the vulnerability. One of the other two was testing for a vulnerability I'd never heard of and couldn't find anything about on Google. I finally tracked down the original tester and it turns out there is a simple tool which tests for the issue and one command line script later the retest was over. The final issue was one that I knew about but had a really good write up that, even if I'd not heard of it, had a full walk through on how to reproduce the test.",

          "description": "When doing reconnaissance on clients it is often useful to try to identify other websites or companies who are related to your target. One way to do this is to look at who is managing the Google Analytics traffic for them and then find who else they manage. There are a few online services which do this, the probably best known being ewhois, but whenever you use someone else's resources you are at their mercy over things like accuracy of the data and coverage, especially if you are working for a small client who hasn't been scanned by them then you won't get any results. This is where my tracker tracking tool comes in. The tool is in two parts, the first uses the power of the nmap engine to scan all the domains you are interested in and pull back tracking codes, these are then output in the standard nmap format along with the page title. I've then written a second script which takes the output and generates a grouped and sorted CSV file which you can then analyse.",

I figured the best way to do this was to build a very simple application then throw in a proxy and see what happened. Unfortunately my proxy of choice, Burp Suite, currently doesn't handle WebSockets so I had to look for one that did. The only one, and this is their claim, that does in the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy, or ZAP for short. I'd been meaning to learn how to use it for a while so this seemed like the perfect opportunity. If anything in here is wrong, please get in touch and I'll fix it, I'm learning as I go along so may well be doing the odd thing wrong however it does all seem to work. I started by writing a small WebSocket based app which I called SocketToMe which has a few basic services, chat, a number guess game and a couple of other features. I figured I'd start with interception then have a look at fuzzing.",

It is enabled by default on all ports so has to be deliberately disabled by an admin to turn it off.\nPorts default to access mode leaving devices such as switches, which need a trunk port, to request it. A port can be changed from one state to the other\nthrough a single DTP packet and there is no authentication, this makes it great as an attacker as you can easily switch your port to trunk mode on any switch\nwhich has DTP enabled.",

It wasn't down completely, I could still access the web interface and read all old mails but hadn't had any new emails in since 4AM on Thursday. I have various other mail accounts, some Gmail, some not, so I tried sending myself mails from those account to see if things were broken or whether I had just become very unpopular. None of the mails got through. I also tested sending emails out and none of those worked either so there was definitely a problem. By Friday lunchtime I'd had a couple of mails but nothing much so I figured I'd better do some digging and get it fixed.",
