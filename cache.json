While our focus was mainly on missing FreeBSD patches in ESXi, we also came across a type confusion bug in code introduced by VMware. This blog post details a vulnerability I discovered in ESXi’s implementation of the setsockopt system call that could lead to a sandbox escape. The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2022-31696 and disclosed as part of the advisory VMSA-2022-003. Additionally, I also explore ESXi’s kernel heap allocator and weaknesses in existing kernel mitigations. \nFor information regarding the initial analysis of the TCP/IP kernel module, VMkernel debug symbols, and porting type information from FreeBSD to ESXi, it is recommend to read our earlier analysis. \nComparing setso…",

Of course, this means we disclose a lot of bugs. And not every disclosure goes according to plan. \nWhy Disclose at All?\nThis is a fine place to start. Why would anyone disclose a bug to a vendor – or anywhere for that matter? In our opinion – disclosure drives action. We hope that the action will be a vendor producing a patch.

          "description": "Introduction Some time ago, I accidentally came across some interesting behaviour in PE files while debugging an unrelated project. I noticed that setting the SectionAlignment value in the NT header to a value lower than the page size (4096) resulted in significant differences in the way that the image is mapped into memory. Rather than following the usual procedure of parsing the section table to construct the image in memory, the loader appeared to map the entire file, including the headers, into memory with read-write-execute (RWX) permissions - the individual section headers were completely ignored. As a result of this behaviour, it is possible to create a PE executable without any sections, yet still capable of executing its own code. The code can even be self-modifying if necessary due to the write permissions that are present by default. One way in which this mode could potentially be abused would be to create a fake section table - on first inspection, this would appear to be a normal PE module containing read-write/read-only data sections, but when launched, the seemingly NX data becomes executable. While I am sure that this technique will have already been discovered (and potentially abused) in the past, I have been unable to find any documentation online describing it. MSDN does briefly mention that the SectionAlignment value can be less than the page size, but it doesn’t elaborate any further on the implications of this. Inside the Windows kernel A quick look in the kernel reveals what is happening. Within MiCreateImageFileMap, we can see the parsing of PE headers - notably, if the SectionAlignment value is less than 0x1000, an undocumented flag (0x200000) is set prior to mapping the image into memory: if(v29-&gt;SectionAlignment &lt; 0x1000) { if((SectionFlags &amp; 0x80000) != 0) { v17 = 0xC000007B; MiLogCreateImageFileMapFailure(v36, v39, *(unsigned int *)(v29 + 64), DWORD1(v99)); ImageFailureReason = 55; goto LABEL_81; } if(!MiLegacyImageArchitecture((unsigned __int16)v99)) { v17 = 0xC000007B; ImageFailureReason = 56; goto LABEL_81; } SectionFlags |= 0x200000; } v40 = MiBuildImageControlArea(a3, v38, v29, (unsigned int)&amp;v99, SectionFlags, (__int64)&amp;FileSize, (__int64)&amp;v93); If the aforementioned flag is set, MiBuildImageControlArea treats the entire file as one single section: if((SectionFlags &amp; 0x200000) != 0) { SectionCount = 1; } else { SectionCount = a4-&gt;NumberOfSections + 1; } v12 = MiAllocatePool(64, 8 * (7 * SectionCount + (((unsigned __int64)(unsigned int)MiFlags &gt;&gt; 13) &amp; 1)) + 184, (SectionFlags &amp; 0x200000) != 0 ? 0x61436D4D : 0x69436D4D); As a result, the raw image is mapped into memory with all PTEs assigned MM_EXECUTE_READWRITE protection. As mentioned previously, the IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER list is ignored, meaning a PE module using this mode can have a NumberOfSections value of 0. There are no obvious size restrictions on PE modules using this mode either - the loader will allocate memory based on the SizeOfImage field and copy the file contents accordingly. Any excess memory beyond the size of the file will remain blank. Demonstration #1 - Executable PE with no sections The simplest demonstration of this technique would be to create a generic “loader” for position-independent code. I have created the following sample headers by hand for testing: // (64-bit EXE headers) BYTE bHeaders64[328] = { 0x4D, 0x5A, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x40, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x50, 0x45, 0x00, 0x00, 0x64, 0x86, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xF0, 0x00, 0x22, 0x00, 0x0B, 0x02, 0x0E, 0x1D, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x48, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x40, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x02, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x02, 0x00, 0x00, 0x06, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x06, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x10, 0x00, 0x48, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x02, 0x00, 0x60, 0x81, 0x00, 0x00, 0x10, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x10, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x10, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x10, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x10, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, // (code goes here) }; BYTE bHeaders32[304] = { 0x4D, 0x5A, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x40, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x50, 0x45, 0x00, 0x00, 0x4C, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xE0, 0x00, 0x02, 0x01, 0x0B, 0x01, 0x0E, 0x1D, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x30, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x40, 0x00, 0x00, 0x02, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x02, 0x00, 0x00, 0x06, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x06, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x10, 0x00, 0x30, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x02, 0x00, 0x40, 0x81, 0x00, 0x00, 0x10, 0x00, 0x00, 0x10, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x10, 0x00, 0x00, 0x10, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x10, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, // (code goes here) }; These headers contain a SectionAlignment value of 0x200 (rather than the usual 0x1000), a SizeOfImage value of 0x100000 (1MB), a blank section table, and an entry-point positioned immediately after the headers. Aside from these values, there is nothing special about the remaining fields: (DOS Header) e_magic : 0x5A4D ... e_lfanew : 0x40 (NT Header) Signature : 0x4550 Machine : 0x8664 NumberOfSections : 0x0 TimeDateStamp : 0x0 PointerToSymbolTable : 0x0 NumberOfSymbols : 0x0 SizeOfOptionalHeader : 0xF0 Characteristics : 0x22 Magic : 0x20B MajorLinkerVersion : 0xE MinorLinkerVersion : 0x1D SizeOfCode : 0x0 SizeOfInitializedData : 0x0 SizeOfUninitializedData : 0x0 AddressOfEntryPoint : 0x148 BaseOfCode : 0x0 ImageBase : 0x140000000 SectionAlignment : 0x200 FileAlignment : 0x200 MajorOperatingSystemVersion : 0x6 MinorOperatingSystemVersion : 0x0 MajorImageVersion : 0x0 MinorImageVersion : 0x0 MajorSubsystemVersion : 0x6 MinorSubsystemVersion : 0x0 Win32VersionValue : 0x0 SizeOfImage : 0x100000 SizeOfHeaders : 0x148 CheckSum : 0x0 Subsystem : 0x2 DllCharacteristics : 0x8160 SizeOfStackReserve : 0x100000 SizeOfStackCommit : 0x1000 SizeOfHeapReserve : 0x100000 SizeOfHeapCommit : 0x1000 LoaderFlags : 0x0 NumberOfRvaAndSizes : 0x10 DataDirectory[0] : 0x0, 0x0 ...

note, several readers have asked how I created this sample code (previously used in another project) which works correctly in both 32-bit and 64-bit modes. The answer is very simple: it begins by storing the original stack pointer value, pushes a value onto the stack, and compares the new stack pointer to the original value. If the difference is 8, the 64-bit code is executed - otherwise, the 32-bit code is executed. While there are certainly more efficient approaches to achieve this outcome, this method is sufficient for demonstration purposes: mov eax, esp ; store stack ptr push 0 ; push a value onto the stack sub eax, esp ; calculate difference pop ecx ; restore stack cmp eax, 8 ; check if the difference is 8 je 64bit_code 32bit_code: xxxx 64bit_code: xxxx By appending this payload to the original headers above, we can generate a valid and functional EXE file. The provided PE headers contain a hardcoded SizeOfImage value of 0x100000 which allows for a maximum payload size of almost 1MB, but this can be increased if necessary. Running this program will display our message box, despite the fact that the PE headers lack any executable sections, or any sections at all in this case: Demonstration #2 - Executable PE with spoofed sections Perhaps more interestingly, it is also possible to create a fake section table using this mode as mentioned earlier. I have created another EXE which follows a similar format to the previous samples, but also includes a single read-only section: The main payload has been stored within this read-only section and the entry-point has been updated to 0x1000. Under normal circumstances, you would expect the program to crash immediately with an access-violation exception due to attempting to execute read-only memory. However, this doesn’t occur here - the target memory region contains RWX permissions and the payload is executed successfully: Notes The sample EXE files can be downloaded here. The proof-of-concepts described above involve appending the payload to the end of the NT headers, but it is also possible to embed executable code within the headers themselves using this technique. The module will fail to load if the AddressOfEntryPoint value is less than the SizeOfHeaders value, but this can easily be bypassed since the SizeOfHeaders value is not strictly enforced. It can even be set to 0, allowing the entry-point to be positioned anywhere within the file. It is possible that this feature was initially designed to allow for very small images, enabling the headers, code, and data to fit within a single memory page. As memory protection is applied per-page, it makes sense to apply RWX to all PTEs when the virtual section size is lower than the page size - it would otherwise be impossible to manage protections correctly if multiple sections resided within a single page. I have tested these EXE files on various different versions of Windows from Vista to 10 with success in all cases. Unfortunately it has very little practical use in the real world as it won’t deceive any modern disassemblers - nonetheless, it remains an interesting concept.",
