The first public information appeared on July 12 with the release of the patch for CVE-2022-22047, which was being actively exploited. Shortly thereafter, Microsoft published an article providing some technical details and revealing that the threat actor involved was an Austrian hack-for-hire group tracked by Microsoft as KNOTWEED. Fortuitously, these developments coincided with closely related research I had been conducting, and in that same month, I reported to Microsoft two additional vulnerabilities affecting the same component.
