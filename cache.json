We’ll be updating this blog as well as social media with results in real time. All times are in Japan Standard Time (GMT +9).\nSUCCESS - Computest Sector 7 used a 2-bug chain to exploit the ChargePoint Home Flex. They earn $30,000 and 6 Master of Pwn Points.\nFAILURE - Connor Ford was not able to get his exploit of the Phoenix Contact CHARX SEC-3100 working in the time allotted.\nSUCCESS Synacktiv exploited the Sony XAV-AX5500. They earn $20,000 and 4 Master of Pwn Points.\nFAILURE - Katsuhiko Sato was not able to get his exploit of the Pioneer DMH-WT7600NEX working in the time allotted.\nSUCCESS - Sina Kheirkhah used a 2-bug chain to exploit the Ubiquiti Connect EV. He earns $30,000 and 6 Master of Pwn Points.\nSUCCESS / BUG COLLISION - fuzzware.io used a 2-bug chain to exploit the Phoenix Contact CHARX SEC-3100. However, one of the bugs was previously known. They still earn $22,500 and 4.5 Master of Pwn Points.\nSUCCESS - Connor Ford of Nettitude used a stack-based buffer overflow in his exploit of the JuiceBox 40 Smart EV Charging Station. He earns $30,000 and 6 Master of Pwn Points.\nSUCCESS / BUG COLLISION - Team Cluck used a 4-bug chain to exploit the Phoenix Contact CHARX SEC-3100. However, one of the bugs was previously known. They still earn $26,250 and 5.25 Master of Pwn Points.\nSUCCESS - fuzzware.io used a buffer overflow to exploit the EMPORIA EV Charger Level 2. They earn $60,000 and 6 Master of Pwn Points.\nThe first ever Pwn2Own Automotive is in the books! We awarded $1,323,750 throughout the event and discovered 49 unique zero-days.

I don’t even know if “fuzzer” is the right word for what we’re building, it’s almost more like an execution engine that will expose hooks? Anyways, if you missed the first episode you can catch up here. We are creating a fuzzer that loads a statically built Bochs emulator into itself, and executes Bochs logic while maintaining a sandbox for Bochs. You can think of it as, we were too lazy to implement our own x86_64 emulator from scratch so we’ve just literally taken a complete emulator and stuffed it into our own process to use it. The fuzzer is written in Rust and Bochs is a C++ codebase. Bochs is a full system emulator, so the devices and everything else is just simulated in software. This is great for us because we can simply snapshot and restore Bochs itself to achieve snapshot fuzzing of our target. So the fuzzer runs Bochs and Bochs runs our target. This allows us to snapshot fuzz arbitrarily complex targets: web browsers, kernels, network stacks, etc. This episode, we’ll delve into the concept of sandboxing Bochs from syscalls. We do not want Bochs to be capable of escaping its sandbox or retrieving any data from outside of our environment. So today we’ll get into the implementation details of my first stab at Bochs-to-fuzzer context switching to handle syscalls. In the future we will also need to implement context switching from fuzzer-to-Bochs as well, but for now let’s focus on syscalls.",

It has been applied to cooperation during war, to trade and commerce, and even to intelligence sharing. That special relationship has clearly influenced the two nations’ recent policy papers on national cybersecurity.

          "description": "To execute .NET post-exploitation tools safely, operators may want to modify certain managed functions. For example, some C# tools use the .NET standard library to terminate their process after execution. This may not be an issue for fork&run implementations that spawn a sacrificial process, but executing in-process will terminate an implant. One could write a small .NET program that resolves and patches these functions, but we were interested in an unmanaged approach (i.e. a unmanaged implant executing managed code in-process). While our example targets System.Environment.Exit, a similar technique should work for any managed function.\n\nIn January 2022, I uploaded a functional example of this approach to my personal GitHub. However, the implementation was a part of a larger project, and I’ve received a few questions about the technique, so I created this standalone example and writeup.\nTags: dotnet\nRead full post\nThe post Unmanaged .NET Patching appeared first on Outflank.",
