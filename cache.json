Although most security professionals may not be surprised by this lack of coverage, one should not overlook these platforms. For example, developers using macOS often have privileged cloud accounts or access to intellectual property like source code. Linux servers may host sensitive databases or customer-facing applications. Defenders must have confidence in their tools for these systems, and attackers must understand how to evade them. This post dives into endpoint security products on macOS and Linux to understand their capabilities and identify weaknesses.\n\nEndpoint detection and response (EDR) agents comprise multiple sensors: components that collect events from one or more telemetry sources. The agent formats raw telemetry data into a standard format and then forwards it to a log aggregator.\nTags: EDR, Linux, macOS\nRead full post\nThe post EDR Internals for macOS and Linux appeared first on Outflank.",
