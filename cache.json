This pre-authentication vulnerability existed in the enableStrongSwanTunnel method of the DescriptionRegistrationListener class. While analyzing this vulnerability, I noticed that the same function was also vulnerable to command injection as root. Cisco patched this initially as CVE-2025-20281(ZDI-25-609), but also released CVE-2025-20337 (ZDI-25-607) to fully address the vulnerability. You’ll see why below.\nExploitation wasn't as straight forward as I'd originally hoped but was ultimately a lot more fun than a normal, run-of-the-mill command injection. In this blog…",

Notably, vulnerabilities in JIT engines are among the most favorite ones as it provides strong primitives and well-known techniques are already available to facilitate compromise. At Pwn2Own Berlin 2025, Manfred Paul compromised the Mozilla Firefox renderer process using a vulnerability in IonMonkey but did not further escape the JavaScript engine sandbox. IonMonkey is the JavaScript JIT compiler for SpiderMonkey (the Firefox JavaScript and WebAssembly engine) This vulnerability is assigned CVE-2025-4919 and Mozilla swiftly fixed it in Mozilla Firefox 138.0.4 via Security Advisory 2025-36 in the following day.

          "description": "Asynchronous BOFs: Enabling New Use Cases for Red Team Operators\nThe introduction of Beacon Object Files (BOFs) by Cobalt Strike in 2020 revolutionized the capabilities of red team operators and developers, offering a standardized interface for operator code to run within, and interact with, an implant. However, the current BOF standard was designed for synchronous operations, limiting its potential applications.\nAsynchronous BOFs Execution Would Enable New Red Team Capabilities\nWithin this blog we introduce the concept and initial design of real-time monitoring for events (e.g. sleep until an admin logs in, sleep until a user starts his password vault) for Beacon Object Files. This new asynchronous design allows operators to roll out a network of sensors and stream these events to the C2 server for further processing – all while the implant is sleepmasked.\nTags: Async, AsyncBOF, BeaconWakeup, BOF, Monitoring, RedTreat, SleepMask\nRead full post\nThe post Async BOFs – “Wake Me Up, Before You Go Go” appeared first on Outflank.",

          "description": "Creating Beacon Object Files (BOFs) allows operators to extend the functionality of a C2 framework, though their development may sometimes involve hidden complexities that only become apparent after the BOF is executed. Today, we introduce a BOF linting tool to address some of the common pitfalls.\nBOFs are lightweight, in-memory modules used in Cobalt Strike and other post-exploitation/C2 frameworks such as Outflank C2 and Core Impact.  They are object files produced by a C compiler (COFF). Cobalt Strike parses this file and acts as a linker and loader for its contents. This approach allows you to write code for use in Beacon, without tedious gymnastics to manage strings and dynamically call Win32 APIs.\nBOFs are powerful and flexible, but their minimalistic design inherently comes with strict constraints.\n\nRead full post\nThe post BOF Linting for Accelerated Development appeared first on Outflank.",
