Indeed, this is a very useful state for research where the user interface is in operation, communications both wired and wireless are working and the mobile device app can interact. However, there are times when there is a need to force the charger into other states so that it behaves as though the electric vehicle is attached, the EV is asking for charge, or the EV is charging and the EVSE is providing charging current.  \nAt the Pwn2Own Automotive 2025 event, an add-on category was introduced that required a demonstra…",

The standout addition is the Dispatch mode, which I prefer to call reasoning mode, enabling administrators to plan complex automation tasks with AI assistance. Prompt Suggestions might better be described as big brother or creepy mode since the AI continually observes your actions and intervenes when it believes you need assistance. Additionally, AI memory functions similarly to the personalization feature in ChatGPT, allowing you to save preferences as Knowledge across sessions.\nSource",
