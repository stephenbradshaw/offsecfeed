Statically detecting these bugs can be challenging. In the past, several approaches have addressed this problem, such as GUEB by Josselin Feist and Sean Heelan's work on Finding use-after-free bugs with static analysis. \nThis blog post explores the usage of Binary Ninja’s Medium Level Intermediate Language (MLIL) to establish a data flow graph by tracing interactions between a specific memory allocation and other memory regions. Building on the data flow graph, it is further utilized in context-insensitive reachability analysis across functions to identify potential Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerabilities in binaries.

Indeed, this is a very useful state for research where the user interface is in operation, communications both wired and wireless are working and the mobile device app can interact. However, there are times when there is a need to force the charger into other states so that it behaves as though the electric vehicle is attached, the EV is asking for charge, or the EV is charging and the EVSE is providing charging current.  \nAt the Pwn2Own Automotive 2025 event, an add-on category was introduced that required a demonstra…",
