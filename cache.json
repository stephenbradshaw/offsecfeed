Our goal is simply to highlight the good work in the community that may go unnoticed. We also want to stay positive with these awards. While it certainly may be fun to point out errors that occur, we think it’s more important to highlight the good work being done that would otherwise go unnoticed.\nFor the Researcher Awards, there are five categories for 2024:\n1.         Best use of the RF enclosure \nDuring …",

We at the Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) agree with them because that’s what we told them back in May when we detected this exploit in the wild and reported it to Microsoft. However, you may notice that no one from Trend or ZDI was acknowledged by Microsoft. This case has become a microcosm of the problems with coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD) as vendors push for coordinated disclosure from researchers but rarely practice any coordination regarding the fix. This lack of transparency from vendors often leaves researchers who practice CVD with more questions than answers.\nIf you’re just interested in the technical details of the bugs we discovered in …",

The article explained in detail how the MSI repair process executes in an elevated context, but the lack of impersonation could lead to Arbitrary File Delete and similar issues. The issue was acknowledged by Microsoft (as CVE-2023-21800), but it was never directly fixed. Instead, the introduction of a Redirection Guard mitigated all symlink attacks in the context of the msiexec process. Back then, I wasn’t particularly happy with the solution, but I couldn’t find any bypass.\nThe Redirection Guard turned out to work exactly as intended, so I spent some time attacking the Windows Installer Service from other angles.
