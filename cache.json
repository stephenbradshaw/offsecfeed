Period.\n\nLet me clarify something quickly before I get roasted. I am not saying that EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) agents don’t have a place, it’s just that they have taken over for Anti-Virus for being mostly preventative and response oriented. Do EDRs detect things? Sure, but in my pentesting and red teaming experience they rarely catch any of the actions I do outside of touching LSASS. Which to be fair, is what a lot of malware and APT actors do. But it won’t stay that way, and Sysmon is f…",

          "description": "Recently I’ve been hearing about malware mounting ISOs as a method of bypassing AV and EDR. For example this article from Bleeping Computer - “Uptick Seen in ISO Email Attachments Delivering Malware” posted December 23rd, 2019, or DARK Reading - “ChromeLoader Malware Hijacks Browsers with ISO Files” posted May 27th, 2022.\nThe problem I found with these articles and many like it didn’t really offer any sort of method to protect yourself or you company from ISO mounted malware, so I went to try to find a solution myself (couldn’t be that hard right?). Turns out that if you google for “Stop Windows from Mounting ISOs” or something similar you get a bunch of MSDN articles for people trying to solve the same issue for one reason or another.\nAfter a lot of googling I found this article on Winaer…",

          "description": "ldapsearch is a extremely powerful tool, especially for Windows Active Directory enumeration. It’s one of my primary tools when performing pentesting or red teaming against an environment with Active Directory, but also comes in quiet handy to know as many times it can come default installed or part of a base image, so its a bit Living-Off-The-Land-esq. Another point towards ldapsearch is that it’s easy to forget that Active Directory isn’t the only LDAP server in most environments and the ability to utilize a tool like this can come in extremely handy.\nIf you want to find Active Directory LDAP servers, use the following command:\n$ dig -t SRV _ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.sittingduck.info\n\n\nBasic Usage\n-x Basic Authentication, you usually use this if you are going to include a username and password…",

And every use of a break glass account should be highly monitored\n\nI think “Least Privilege” has been harped on at least … you know what, let me wager that you can’t find a single infosec or hacking conference from 2000 until now (2022) that doesn’t have 4 talks with the words “least privilege” in the talk.
