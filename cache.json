          "description": "ldapsearch is a extremely powerful tool, especially for Windows Active Directory enumeration. It’s one of my primary tools when performing pentesting or red teaming against an environment with Active Directory, but also comes in quiet handy to know as many times it can come default installed or part of a base image, so its a bit Living-Off-The-Land-esq. Another point towards ldapsearch is that it’s easy to forget that Active Directory isn’t the only LDAP server in most environments and the ability to utilize a tool like this can come in extremely handy.\nIf you want to find Active Directory LDAP servers, use the following command:\n$ dig -t SRV _ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.sittingduck.info\n\n\nBasic Usage\n-x Basic Authentication, you usually use this if you are going to include a username and password…",

That could be 20 years ago. Technology changes faster than you do.\n\nI guess that’s a bit mean for a title but here’s the thing:\nOne of the greatest yet most challenging things about doing any job in technology is staying current. Everyone struggles to stay up to date with as much of what is going on around you. Many people specialize, which makes it easier to stay up to date with a specific thing. Yet that can lead to tunnel vision as well.\nAll I’m trying to say here is that sometimes, the person with the least amount of “experience” in a given technology field is going to have the most open mind to what is possible. No matter how long you have been in cyber security or technology in general, you should consider your knowledge on a specific topic a point in time piece of information. At that exact moment in your life, that fact was true. This doesn’t mean that it stays that way.\nTake passwords for example. Everyone said “8 character passwords are secure” for decades. I’m still hearing that. Or “never write your passwords down”. This is just one example. “Never use X software, it’s insecure”, is it still?. One of the ways I stay “current” is by always challenging my knowledge of how I think things should work vs how they do.\nThis is why during my keynote I noted when and where I leaned these lessons, there is every possibility I am complete off base with all of them. This is also why it’s my beautiful basics lesson #1. Something to always keep top of mind.",

It was an honor to be asked and I had a great time.\nConference Link: https://hopin.com/events/bsides-vancouver-2022/\nI talked about 11 lessons learned over my career that contradict some of the edicts that are well known in the Cyber Security space.\nBefore we get into the lessons though, let me attack the things I know many of you reading this already have queued up in your head.\n\nCounter Point 1\n“All of that is well and good, but it’ll never work where I work.”\nWhy not? Every single one of these lessons learned are things that I was told wasn’t possible. For the most part they were things I didn’t even do, they were things either already in place when I joined the company or put into place while I worked there.\nI saw first hand that something I was told was “impossible” was not only possible but accomplished much more than I could have imagined. Until you see something for yourself, it’s hard to go against what you are taught, but as Security Professionals isn’t that what we are supposed to do? Look beyond the scope of what is seen as “possible”?\nCounter Point 2\n“It’s not as easy as you are making it sound.”\nYou are right, none of this is easy. Good work hardly ever is. If you are looking for the easy solution, something that can be done in a day or a week this is not the blog series for you.\nCounter Point 3\n“We already known all of this”\nAwesome! I wish I would have known these things earlier in my career.\nLessons Learned\nLesson 1\nLesson 2\nLesson 3\nLesson 4\nLesson 5\nLesson 6\nLesson 7\nLesson 8\nLesson 9\nLesson 10\nLesson 11",
