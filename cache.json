Whether you’re debugging, trying to see a process crash, or trying to write an exploit, it can be super duper annoying! In a few days, I’m giving a talk at NorthSec in Montreal. I asked some co-workers to review my slides, and they commented that I have some neat techniques to deal with forking, so I thought I’d share a couple! Spoiler alert: The last one is the best, so you can just skip to that. :)",

In total, $105,000 was awarded to the three teams, with the team of Toan Pham and Tri Dang from Qrious Secure winning $60,000 since their entry was first on the schedule. Part of Pwn2Own competitions involves a random drawing for order. Not only does the team selected first get the full award if they are successful, but the subsequent entries are also more likely to have bug collisions. That means if three teams show up with the same exploit, only the first one randomly selected will get full credit. That’s not exactly what happened during the event, but some bug collisions did occur. In fact, there were four unique bugs used by the three different teams. Let’s take a look at the vulnerabilitie…",

His successful demonstration earned him $80,000 and 8 points towards Master of Pwn.
