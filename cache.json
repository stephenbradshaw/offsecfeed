TAG’s blog post covers the targeting and the actor behind the campaign. This is a technical analysis of the final stage of one of the exploit chains, specifically CVE-2023-0266 (a 0-day in the ALSA compatibility layer) and CVE-2023-26083 (a 0-day in the Mali GPU driver) as well as the techniques used by the attacker to gain kernel arbitrary read/write access.\n\nNotably, all of the previous stages of the exploit chain used n-day vulnerabilities:\n\n\nCVE-2022-4262, a vulnerability patched in Chrome that was unpatched in the Samsung browser (i.e. a \"Chrome n-day\"), was used to achieve RCE.\n\n\nCVE-2022-3038, another Chrome n-…",

This open-source tool, now available on our GitHub, offers a novel way to hijack a victim’s browser sessions, utilizing them as a visual proxy after hooking via an XSS or a malicious webpage. While some exploitation frameworks, such as BeEF, do provide hooking features, they don’t allow remote visual interactions.\nSHVE’s interaction with a victim’s browser in the security context of the user relies on a comprehensive design incorporating multiple elements. These components, each fulfilling a specific function, form a complex, interconnected system that allows a precise and controlled session hijacking. Let’s take a closer look at each of them:\nVictimServer: This comp…",
