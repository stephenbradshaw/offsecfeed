Whether you’re debugging, trying to see a process crash, or trying to write an exploit, it can be super duper annoying! In a few days, I’m giving a talk at NorthSec in Montreal. I asked some co-workers to review my slides, and they commented that I have some neat techniques to deal with forking, so I thought I’d share a couple! Spoiler alert: The last one is the best, so you can just skip to that. :)",

In an otherwise unencrypted protocol, why is one of the messages unreadable? It took me a few hours to accomplish what should have been a couple minutes of effort, and I wanted to share the trick I ultimately used! I’m going to be intentionally vague on the software, and even modify a few things to make it harder to identify; I’ll probably publish a lot more on my work blog once I’m finished this project!",

The risks of detection outweigh the need for having an implant “parasiting” in a host process. Typical process injection techniques stand out too much and more often than not is the injection linked to malicious activity. Occasionally, I like to pick-up this “AV evasion” hobby, and achieving process injection with arguably the most signatured malicious shellcode against today’s best endpoint protection, seemed like a fun exercise to me.",
