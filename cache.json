What appears to be SSRF may sometimes in fact be intended functionality.

We’re back with an exciting update on Session Hijacking Visual Exploitation (SHVE) that introduces an insidious twist to traditional exploitation techniques using Office documents. We all know how Office documents laced with macros have been a longstanding entry point for infiltrating systems. SHVE now takes a step further by leveraging XSS vulnerabilities and the inherent trust users have in websites they regularly visit.\nOur newest feature integrates the concept of Office document poisoning. Here’s how it works: SHVE allows you to upload templates for .docm, .pptm, and .xslm formats. Whenever a victim of SHVE goes to download one of these document types, the tool will automatically intercept and inject the malicious macros into the file before it is downloaded. What makes t…",

Recently, for Linux Kernel exploitation reasons, I’ve been very interested in Nyx. Nyx is a KVM-based hypervisor fuzzer that you can use to snapshot fuzz traditionally hard to fuzz targets. A lot of the time (most of the time?), we want to fuzz things that don’t naturally lend themselves well to traditional fuzzing approaches. When faced with target complexity in fuzzing (leaving input generation and nuance aside for now), there have generally been two approaches.",
