          "description": "Some memory corruption bugs are much harder to exploit than others. They can involve race conditions, crash the system, and impose limitations that make a researcher's life difficult. Working with such fragile vulnerabilities demands significant time and effort. CVE-2024-50264 in the Linux kernel is one such hard bug, which received the Pwnie Award 2025 as the Best Privilege Escalation. In this article, I introduce my personal project kernel-hack-drill and show how it helped me to exploit CVE-2024-50264.",

Even after patching the code to bypass authentication, most interesting operations required interacting with handlers and state we initially omitted. In this part, we explain how we increased coverage and applied different fuzzing strategies to identify more bugs.\nSome functionalities require additional configuration options. We tried to enable many available features to maximize the exposed attack surface. This helped us trigger code paths that are disabled in the minimalistic configuration example. However, to simplify our setup, we did not consider features like Kerberos support or RDMA. These could be…",
