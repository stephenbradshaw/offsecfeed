In this blog post, I would like to show you my personal best research of the competition: the custom deserialization issue in Inductive Automation Ignition. \nThere are several things that make this vulnerability interesting, including the following:\n·       It exists in a custom deserialization routine, which seems to derive some inspiration from the Java XMLDecoder.\n·       It allows you to gain Remote Code Execution on two hosts at the same time: the client where the malicious project file is initially loaded, as well as the server that ultimately handles the file.\n·       There is a nice platform that can help an attacker deliver the malicious file to potential victims.\n·       I…",

The first public information appeared on July 12 with the release of the patch for CVE-2022-22047, which was being actively exploited. Shortly thereafter, Microsoft published an article providing some technical details and revealing that the threat actor involved was an Austrian hack-for-hire group tracked by Microsoft as KNOTWEED. Fortuitously, these developments coincided with closely related research I had been conducting, and in that same month, I reported to Microsoft two additional vulnerabilities affecting the same component.

Similar to last year, we’ll be holding a hybrid conference with most of us in person at the Sheraton Wall Center in Vancouver for the CanSecWest conference on March 22-24, 2023. The other part of the hybrid event means that we also allow remote participation.
