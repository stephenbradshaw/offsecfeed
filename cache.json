Other Ivanti products have recently been under active exploitation, and the mobile device management system is an attractive target. This bug was originally reported to the ZDI program by an anonymous researcher and was also discovered by Lucas Miller of Trend Micro Research. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability would allow an authenticated attacker to execute code in the context of SYSTEM.

          "description": "To execute .NET post-exploitation tools safely, operators may want to modify certain managed functions. For example, some C# tools use the .NET standard library to terminate their process after execution. This may not be an issue for fork&run implementations that spawn a sacrificial process, but executing in-process will terminate an implant. One could write a small .NET program that resolves and patches these functions, but we were interested in an unmanaged approach (i.e. a unmanaged implant executing managed code in-process). While our example targets System.Environment.Exit, a similar technique should work for any managed function.\n\nIn January 2022, I uploaded a functional example of this approach to my personal GitHub. However, the implementation was a part of a larger project, and I’ve received a few questions about the technique, so I created this standalone example and writeup.\nTags: dotnet\nRead full post\nThe post Unmanaged .NET Patching appeared first on Outflank.",
