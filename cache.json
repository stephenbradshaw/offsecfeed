So imagine my surprise when I bypassed an SSRF mitigation during a routine retest. Even worse, I have bypassed a filter that we have recommended ourselves! I couldn’t let it slip and had to get to the bottom of the issue.\nIntroduction\nServer Side Request Forgery is a vulnerability in which a malicious actor exploits a victim server to perform HTTP(S) requests on the attacker’s behalf. Since the server usually has access to the internal network, this attack is useful to bypass firewalls and IP whitelists to access hosts otherwise inaccessible to the attacker.\nRequest Library Vulnerability\nSSRF attacks can be prevented with address filtering, assuming there are no filter bypasses.

          "description": "Arbitrary file write (AFW) vulnerabilities in web application uploads can be a powerful tool for an attacker, potentially allowing them to escalate their privileges and even achieve remote code execution (RCE) on the server. However, the specific tactics that can be used to achieve this escalation often depend on the specific scenario faced by the attacker. In the wild, there can be several scenarios that an attacker may encounter when attempting to escalate from AFW to RCE in web applications. These can generically be categorized as:\nControl of the full file path or of the file name only: In this scenario, the attacker has the ability to control the full file path or the name of the uploaded file, but not its contents.

Log Explorer provides the same data but as part of a graphical user interface (GUI) within the Google Cloud console and with a 10,000 event export limit. Lastly, Pub/Sub is a method through which we can push or pull logs to an external platform, such as a SIEM.
