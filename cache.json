This post examines how JSON, XML, and YAML parsers in Go handle edge cases in ways that have repeatedly resulted in high-impact security issues in production systems. We explore three real-world attack scenarios: marshaling/unmarshaling unexpected data, exploiting parser differentials, and leveraging data format confusion. Through examples, we demonstrate how attackers can bypass authentication, circumvent authorization controls, and exfiltrate sensitive data by exploiting these parser behaviors.",

          "description": "This blog post is the second part in a series about using Secure Enclaves for Offensive Operations. The first part discussed the basics of how enclaves work, provided some ideas on how to develop your own enclave, as well as analyze and debug existing enclaves. We also hinted at how enclaves could potentially be used for offensive purposes. Remember: VTL0 is where the normal kernel lives, VTL1 is where the secure kernel operates (and our enclaves).\nIn this follow-up post, we will share what we discovered while digging into enclave internals. It’s been a hands-on journey filled with many (failed) experiments. We’ll walk you through some of the practical techniques we used to exploit a read-write primitive in a vulnerable enclave DLL, and how we managed to turn that into VTL1 code execution.\n\n\n\nThe outcome of this research has been integrated into Outflank C2 (part of our OST offering) for implant sleepmasking.\n\nRead full post\nThe post Secure Enclaves for Offensive Operations (Part II) appeared first on Outflank.",
