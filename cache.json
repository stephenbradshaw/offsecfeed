This collaboration has led to major milestones, including paying security researchers over $1M in bounties. To celebrate this achievement and their 10-year partnership, we spoke with Jim Higgins, Snap's Chief Information Security Officer, Vinay Prabhushankar, Snap’s Security Engineering Manager, and Ilana Arbisser, Snap’s Privacy Engineer.",

Statically detecting these bugs can be challenging. In the past, several approaches have addressed this problem, such as GUEB by Josselin Feist and Sean Heelan's work on Finding use-after-free bugs with static analysis. \nThis blog post explores the usage of Binary Ninja’s Medium Level Intermediate Language (MLIL) to establish a data flow graph by tracing interactions between a specific memory allocation and other memory regions. Building on the data flow graph, it is further utilized in context-insensitive reachability analysis across functions to identify potential Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerabilities in binaries. Like any other static code analysis approach,…",

The idle state is straightforward and usually involves nothing more than powering up the charger. Indeed, this is a very useful state for research where the user interface is in operation, communications both wired and wireless are working and the mobile device app can interact. However, there are times when there is a need to force the charger into other states so that it behaves as though the electric vehicle is attached, the EV is asking for charge, or the EV is charging and the EVSE is providing charging current.  \nAt the Pwn2Own Automotive 2025 event, an add-on category was introduced that required a demonstra…",

Despite working with Ubuntu for 15 years, this was the first time I encountered it. Since this was a relatively new installation of Ubuntu 24.04, I was perplexed as to why I couldn't install all security updates using apt upgrade. After some investigation, I discovered I was using Ubuntu Standard, while only Ubuntu Pro qualifies for all security updates. I felt annoyed and deceived because my system had no uncommon packages, and everything I installed came from the Ubuntu repository. This means that, in most cases, a fresh installation of the latest Ubuntu Linux LTS release does not receive all critical security updates.\nSource",
