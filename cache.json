          "description": "Today I keynoted @BSidesVancouver. It was an honor to be asked and I had a great time.\nConference Link: https://hopin.com/events/bsides-vancouver-2022/\nI talked about 11 lessons learned over my career that contradict some of the edicts that are well known in the Cyber Security space.\nBefore we get into the lessons though, let me attack the things I know many of you reading this already have queued up in your head.\n\nCounter Point 1\n“All of that is well and good, but it’ll never work where I work.”\nWhy not? Every single one of these lessons learned are things that I was told wasn’t possible. For the most part they were things I didn’t even do, they were things either already in place when I joined the company or put into place while I worked there.\nI saw first hand that something I was told was “impossible” was not only possible but accomplished much more than I could have imagined. Until you see something for yourself, it’s hard to go against what you are taught, but as Security Professionals isn’t that what we are supposed to do? Look beyond the scope of what is seen as “possible”?\nCounter Point 2\n“It’s not as easy as you are making it sound.”\nYou are right, none of this is easy. Good work hardly ever is. If you are looking for the easy solution, something that can be done in a day or a week this is not the blog series for you.\nCounter Point 3\n“We already known all of this”\nAwesome! I wish I would have known these things earlier in my career.\nLessons Learned\nLesson 1\nLesson 2\nLesson 3\nLesson 4\nLesson 5\nLesson 6\nLesson 7\nLesson 8\nLesson 9\nLesson 10\nLesson 11",

In the examples below, we explain how to create a harness for the non-default network device driver PCNet. The example can be readily adjusted for a different network driver or even different device driver components.\nWe are aware that there are excellent resources related to this topic - see [1], [2]. However, these cover the fuzzing process from a high-level perspective or omit some important technical details. Our goal is to present all the necessary steps and code required to instrument and debug the latest stable version of VirtualBox (6.1.30 at the time of writing).
