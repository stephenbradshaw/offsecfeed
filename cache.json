If you want to read about other Autel bugs reported at Pwn2Own, you check out our earlier blog here.\nThe First Vulnerability: CVE-2024-23967 (ZDI-CAN-23230)\nResearchers from Computest Sector 7 identified and exploited a stack-based buffer overflow in v1.32 of the Autel firmware. This vulnerability stems from the decoding of base64 encoded data that can be controlled by an attacker. The encoded data is decoded into a fixed-size stack buffer with no bounds checks, leading to a stack buffer overflow and remote code execution.…",

This idea was initially discussed in a blog post about prototype pollution in Python, in which the researcher used recursive merging to poison class variables and eventually global variables via the __globals__ attribute.\nIn Ruby, we can categorize class pollution into three main cases:\nMerge on Hashes: In this scenario, class pollution isn’t possible because the merge operation is confined to the hash itself.\nMerge on Attributes (Non-Recursive): Here, we can poison the instance varia…",

Please also read it if you want to know why it is important to block AI scrapers. One way that works reliably for 4sysops is leveraging Cloudflare's Web Application Firewall (WAF). Cloudflare's free plan provides all the essential tools to safeguard your site against content theft by AI companies. However, I found that Cloudflare's new Block AI Scrapers and Crawlers feature is insufficient for the task. Fortunately, Cloudflare's WAF is sophisticated enough to reliably block all AI scrapers and other web parasites with a single, relatively simple rule. My proposed method serves as a way to enforce an opt-in approach, rather than relying on the non-binding opt-out recommendations in your robots.txt file.",
