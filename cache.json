We at the Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) agree with them because that’s what we told them back in May when we detected this exploit in the wild and reported it to Microsoft. However, you may notice that no one from Trend or ZDI was acknowledged by Microsoft. This case has become a microcosm of the problems with coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD) as vendors push for coordinated disclosure from researchers but rarely practice any coordination regarding the fix. This lack of transparency from vendors often leaves researchers who practice CVD with more questions than answers.\nIf you’re just interested in the technical details of the bugs we discovered in …",

As an incredibly reductive summary: fuzzing is an automated, random testing process which tries to explore the state space (e.g., different interpretations of the input or behaviour) of a program under test (PUT; sometimes also SUT, DUT, etc.). Fuzzing is often celebrated as one of the most effective ways to find bugs in programs due to its inherently random nature, which defies human expectation or bias1. The strategy has found countless security-critical bugs (think tens or hundreds of thousands) over its 30-odd-years of existence, and yet faces regular suspicion from industry and academia alike. Mostly. Fuzzers can be overfit to certain applications, intentionally or not. &#8617;",

Like any external dependency, they introduce additional complexity for the developers building an application. In the real world, however, they are usually considered and used as a black box which provides storage functionality.\nThis post aims shed light on a particular aspect of the complexity databases introduce which is often overlooked by developers, namely concurrency control. The best way to do that is to start off by looking at a fairly common code pattern we at Doyensec see in our day-to-day work:\n\nfunc (db *Db) Transfer(source int, destination int, amount int) error {\n  ctx := context.Background()\n\n  conn, err := pgx.Connect(ctx, db.databaseUrl)\n  defer conn.Close(ctx)\n\n  // (1)\n  tx, err := conn.BeginTx(ctx)\n\n  …",
