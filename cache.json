Please also read it if you want to know why it is important to block AI scrapers. One way that works reliably for 4sysops is leveraging Cloudflare's Web Application Firewall (WAF). Cloudflare's free plan provides all the essential tools to safeguard your site against content theft by AI companies. However, I found that Cloudflare's new Block AI Scrapers and Crawlers feature is insufficient for the task. Fortunately, Cloudflare's WAF is sophisticated enough to reliably block all AI scrapers and other web parasites with a single, relatively simple rule. My proposed method serves as a way to enforce an opt-in approach, rather than relying on the non-binding opt-out recommendations in your robots.txt file.",
