You might think that’s unlikely, but a surprising number of enterprise applications (usually hardware stuff - firewalls, network “security” appliances, stuff like that) is powered by CGI scripts. You never know! This challenge was inspired by one of my co-workers at GreyNoise asking how to debug a CGI script. I thought it’d be cool to make a multi-challenge series in case others didn’t know!

By inducing authentication through DCOM it can be relayed to a network service, such as Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) to elevated privileges and in some cases get domain administrator access.\nThe important difference with this new research is taking the abuse of DCOM authentication from local access (in the case of the many Potatoes) to fully remote by abusing security configuration changes or over granting group access. For more information I'd recommend reading the slides from Tianze Ding Blackhat ASIA 2024 presentation, or reading about SilverPotato by Andrea Pierini.\nThis short blog post is directly based on slide 36 of Tianze …",
