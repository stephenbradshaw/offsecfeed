This bug in the TP-Link Archer AX21 Wi-Fi router was originally disclosed to ZDI during the Pwn2Own Toronto event, where it was used by Team Viettel in their LAN-side entry against the TP-Link device and by Qrious Security in their WAN-side entry.  \nBoth teams’ entries were successful at the contest, and the vulnerabilities were disclosed to the vendor. Interestingly, the bug was also used by the Tenable team in their unsuccessful Pwn2Own attempt against the device. They, too, disclosed the bug to TP-Link, but their public report…",

Luca’s successful entry earned him $40,000 and 4 points towards Master of Pwn.

Both binaries run with root privileges and both invoke bash scripts to run commands with the privileges of root. For such use cases, bash specifically provides a privileged mode using the “-p” flag.

I can find a myriad of issues with any computer programming, but I also acknowledge the benefits of cyber innovation and the need to support new ideas, growth, and participation in the field. Digital Forensics and Incident Response focus on confirming malicious threats, identifying threat actors, and shedding the light on vulnerabilities. In this field of cyber investigation, I’ve come across the ‘smoking gun’ with fingerprints on it. You may not always know the name of the threat actor but it’s rewarding to discover the ‘fingerprint’ that identifies a threat or breach. At that moment, you better have your happy dance perfected!",
