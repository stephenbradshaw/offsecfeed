We’re always excited to return to Vancouver for the event, but we are cognizant of the evolution of the event as well. The contest began with a single Mac Book, but over the years, it grew to include web browsers, enterprise applications, virtualization solutions, and an automotive category. Last year, we awarded over $1,000,000 in cash and prizes – including a Tesla Model 3. This year, we evolved again by simplifying the Automotive category and adding a Cloud-Native/Container category. \nWe introduced the Virtualization category back in …",
