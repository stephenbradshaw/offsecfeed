After that experience, some friends and I founded the r00tstici CTF team, attempting to bring some cybersecurity culture to the south of Italy. We also organized various workshops and events at the University of Salento.\nOnce I moved from south of Italy to Pisa, to study at the university, I joined the fibonhack CTF team. I then also started working as a developer and penetration tester on small projects, both inside the university and outside.\nGetting recruited\nDuring April 2023, the Doyensec Twitter…",

So, in addition to dynamically testing applications, we typically audit our clients’ source code as well. This process is often software-assisted, with open source and off-the-shelf tools. Modern comprehensive versions of these tools offer the capabilities to detect the inclusion of vulnerable third-party libraries, commonly referred to as software composition analysis (SCA).\n\n\n\nThree well-known tools in the SCA space are Snyk, Semgrep and Dependabot. The first two are stand-alone applications, with cloud components to them and the last is integrated into the GitHub(.com) environment directly.
