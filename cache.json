If you’re only interested in the vulnerability itself, then jump right there\nIntroduction\nRecently, I decided to research a single common aspect of many popular Windows applications - their MSI installer packages.\nNot every application is distributed this way. Some applications implement custom bootstrapping mechanisms, some are just meant to be dropped on the disk. However, in a typical enterprise environment, some form of control over the installed packages is often desired. Using the MSI packages simplifies the installation process for any number of systems and also provides additional benefits such as automatic repair, easy patching, and compatibili…",

          "description": "Arbitrary file write (AFW) vulnerabilities in web application uploads can be a powerful tool for an attacker, potentially allowing them to escalate their privileges and even achieve remote code execution (RCE) on the server. However, the specific tactics that can be used to achieve this escalation often depend on the specific scenario faced by the attacker. In the wild, there can be several scenarios that an attacker may encounter when attempting to escalate from AFW to RCE in web applications. These can generically be categorized as:\nControl of the full file path or of the file name only: In this scenario, the attacker has the ability to control the full file path or the name of the uploaded file, but not its contents. Depending on the permissions applied to the target directory and on th…",

Log Explorer provides the same data but as part of a graphical user interface (GUI) within the Google Cloud console and with a 10,000 event export limit.
