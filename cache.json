          "description": "On Windows, named pipes are a form of interprocess communication (IPC) that allows processes to communicate with one another, both locally and across the network. Named pipes serve as a mechanism to transfer data between Windows components as well as third-party applications and services. Both locally as well as on a domain. From an offensive perspective, named pipes may leak some information that could be useful for reconnaissance purposes. Since named pipes can also be used (depending on configuration) to access services remotely – they could allow remote exploits (MS08-067).\nIn this post we will explore how named pipes can be listed remotely in offensive operations, for example via an implant running on a compromised Windows system.\nRead more: Listing remote named pipes\nSeveral tools already exist to list named pipes.\n\nRead full post\nThe post Listing remote named pipes appeared first on Outflank.",

          "description": "For avoiding EDR userland hooks, there are many ways to cook an egg:\nDirect system calls (syscalls), Indirect syscalls, unhooking, hardware breakpoints, and bringing and loading your own version of a library. These methods each have advantages and disadvantages. When developing a C2 implant it’s nice to work with a combination of multiple of these. For instance, you could use a strong (in)direct syscall library for direct usermode to kernel transition, then use unhooking or hardware breakpoints for user mode-only (to bypass AMSI, ETW e.g.) functions.\nRegarding system calls, excellent research has already been done. A small selection of relevant blog posts is Klezvirus’ post on syswhispers, MDSec’s post on direct invocation of system calls and our own blog post on combining direct system calls srdi.\nSo,\nTags: BOF, detect hooks, LoadLibrary, OPSEC safe, OST, syscalls, Unhooking\nRead full post\nThe post Solving The “Unhooking” Problem appeared first on Outflank.",
