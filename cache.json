You never know! This challenge was inspired by one of my co-workers at GreyNoise asking how to debug a CGI script. I thought it’d be cool to make a multi-challenge series in case others didn’t know!

          "description": "Recently, there's been some good research into further exploiting DCOM authentication that I initially reported to Microsoft almost 10 years ago. By inducing authentication through DCOM it can be relayed to a network service, such as Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) to elevated privileges and in some cases get domain administrator access.\nThe important difference with this new research is taking the abuse of DCOM authentication from local access (in the case of the many Potatoes) to fully remote by abusing security configuration changes or over granting group access. For more information I'd recommend reading the slides from Tianze Ding Blackhat ASIA 2024 presentation, or reading about SilverPotato by Andrea Pierini.\nThis short blog post is directly based on slide 36 of Tianze …",

He used this bug as a part of his winning exploit that led to code execution in the renderer of both browsers. This bug was quickly patched by both Google and Microsoft. Manfred has graciously provided this detailed write-up of the vulnerability and how he exploited it at the contest.\nIn this blog, I describe a means of exploiting the V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine to gain execution of arbitrary shellcode inside the renderer process. This includes a bypass of the V8 memory sandbox (Ubercage), though code execution is still constrained by the process isolation-based browser sandbox. For demonstration purposes, this …",

It analyzes real-time HTTP traffic and scales out (adds instances) or scales in (removes instances) to match demand. The most significant advantage of Automatic Scaling is that it simplifies web application management, offering a less complex approach than services like Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), which often require detailed rule definitions.",
