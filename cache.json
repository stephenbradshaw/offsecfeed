          "description": "Introduction\nDuring my recent internship with Doyensec, I had the opportunity to research decompression attacks across different programming languages. As the use of archive file formats is widespread in software development, it is crucial for developers to understand the potential security risks involved in handling these files.\nThe objective of my research was to identify, analyze, and detect vulnerable implementations in several popular programming languages used for web and app development, including Python, Ruby, Swift, Java, PHP, and JavaScript. These languages have libraries for archive decompression that, when used improperly, may potentially lead to vulnerabilities.\nTo demonstrate the risk of unsafe unpacking, I created proof-of-concept (PoC) code with different vulnerable impleme…",
