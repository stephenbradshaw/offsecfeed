This helps me get a sense of what subsystems are producing the most bugs at the moment in the program and also keeps me up to date on buggy patterns to look for. Also I get to shamelessly steal players’ exploitation techniques as well. A lot of recent bugs have come from /net/sched so I was looking at patches for the subsystem and found a patch that claimed an exploitable UAF was possible. That patch is here. I didn’t realize at the time, but “Lion Ackermann” mentioned in the patch as the bug discoverer (and presumably exploiter) is a kCTF player.",
