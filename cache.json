          "description": "Recently, I had the privilege to write a detailed analysis of CVE-2023-34362, which is series of several vulnerabilities in the MOVEit file transfer application that lead to remote code execution. One of the several vulnerabilities involved an ISAPI module - specifically, the MoveITISAPI.dll ISAPI extension. One of the many vulnerabilities that comprised the MOVEit RCE was a header-injection issue, where the ISAPI application parsed headers differently than the .net application. This point is going to dig into how to analyze and reverse engineer an ISAPI-based service! This wasn’t the first time in the recent past I’d had to work on something written as an ISAPI module, and each time I feel like I have to start over and remember how it’s supposed to work. This time, I thought I’d combine my hastily-scrawled notes with some Googling, and try to write something that I (and others) can use in the future. As such, this will be a quick intro to ISAPI applications from the angle that matters to me - how to reverse engineer and debug them! I want to preface this with: I’m not a Windows developer, and I’ve never run an IIS server on purpose. That means that I am approaching this with brute-force ignorance! I don’t have a lot of background context nor do I know the correct terminology for a lot of this stuff. Instead, I’m going to treat these are typical DLLs from typical applications, and approach them as such.",

The contest will be held at the Trend Micro office in Toronto on October 24-27. We had a great event last year, and we’re looking forward to another exciting contest. One of the things that made it so great was having so many of the competitors hanging out all day. We had so many fantastic discussions with talented researchers, and in-person attendance was key to that experience. While we are still allowing remote participation, we’ll be reimbursing up to $3,000 for travel expenses for former Pwn2Own winners that choose to come to Toronto to participate. We also will be able to host a limited audience for those who wish to attend and observe the contest, so look out for…",

This bug was originally submitted to the ZDI program by an anonymous researcher. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Similar bugs are reported as being exploited in the wild. The following is a portion of their write-up covering CVE-2023-24941, with a few minimal modifications.\nAn insecure deserialization vulnerability has been reported in VMware …",

While our focus was mainly on missing FreeBSD patches in ESXi, we also came across a type confusion bug in code introduced by VMware. This blog post details a vulnerability I discovered in ESXi’s implementation of the setsockopt system call that could lead to a sandbox escape. The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2022-31696 and disclosed as part of the advisory VMSA-2022-003. Additionally, I also explore ESXi’s kernel heap allocator and weaknesses in existing kernel mitigations. \nFor information regarding the initial analysis of the TCP/IP kernel module, VMkernel debug symbols, and porting type information from FreeBSD to ESXi, it is recommend to read our earlier analysis. \nComparing setso…",
