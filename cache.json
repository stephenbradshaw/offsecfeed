A sample payload that implements this technique was publicly shared recently. This sample was generated using our Outflank Security Tooling (OST) offering and hence we decided to publish additional details on this method and its discovery.\n\nContext of this blog post\nRecently, Elastic released details on a new initial access vector technique leveraging MSC files, which they dubbed “GrimResource”. These files can be used to execute code within MMC (Microsoft Management Console). This technique was researched and developed by Outflank as part of the Outflank Security Tooling (OST) toolkit.

Stage1 began as a minimal framework, with its sole focus being an initial access implant with some nifty OPSEC and C2 characteristics. It was ideal for initial reconnaissance, modifying C2 channels if needed, and OPSEC safe techniques for loading another C2 framework once you required stage-2 capabilities.\nAs more red teams adopted OST, Stage1 quickly proved to be an unexpectedly popular framework, with users providing consistently positive feedback and requests for more features.\n\nRead full post\nThe post Introducing Outflank C2 with Implant Support for Windows, macOS, and Linux appeared first on Outflank.",
