Whether you’re debugging, trying to see a process crash, or trying to write an exploit, it can be super duper annoying! In a few days, I’m giving a talk at NorthSec in Montreal. I asked some co-workers to review my slides, and they commented that I have some neat techniques to deal with forking, so I thought I’d share a couple! Spoiler alert: The last one is the best, so you can just skip to that. :)",

In an otherwise unencrypted protocol, why is one of the messages unreadable? It took me a few hours to accomplish what should have been a couple minutes of effort, and I wanted to share the trick I ultimately used! I’m going to be intentionally vague on the software, and even modify a few things to make it harder to identify; I’ll probably publish a lot more on my work blog once I’m finished this project!",

His successful demonstration earned him $80,000 and 8 points towards Master of Pwn.

          "description": "This post shows how a malicious website can take control of a ChatGPT chat session and exfiltrate the history of the conversation.\nPlugins, Tools and Integrations With plugins, data exfiltration can happen by sending too much data into the plugin in the first place. More security controls and insights on what is being sent to the plugin are required to empower users.\nHowever, this post is not about sending too much data to a plugin, but about a malicious actor who controls the data a plugin retrieves.",

ChatGPT (via Plugins) can access YouTube transcripts. Which is pretty neat. However, as expected (and predicted by many researches) all these quickly built tools and integrations introduce Indirect Prompt Injection vulnerabilities.\nProof of Concept Here is how it looks with ChatGPT end to end with a demo example.",

Especially Indirect Prompt Injections are dangerous as we discussed before.\nIndirect Prompt Injections allow untrusted data to take control of the LLM (large language model) and give an AI a new instructions, mission and objective.\nBypassing Input Validation Attack payloads are natural language. This means there are lots of creative ways an adversary can inject malicious data that bypass input filters and web application firewalls.",
