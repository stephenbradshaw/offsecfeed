          "description": "Software security has come a long way in the past two decades. With the advent of new technologies and a rapidly evolving threat landscape, defending against cyber attacks has become more challenging than ever before. We recently presented on the evolution of software security threats and defense strategies at the Security Summit in Milan on 15th March 2023. In this blog post, we'll explore some of the key takeaways from the presentation.\nIn the early 1990s, the Internet was still in its infancy, and most people accessed it through their workstations or personal computers. Security threats were relatively simple, and malware and viruses were typically spread through floppy disks or infected email attachments. As the Internet became more ubiquitous, so did the security threats. In the early…",

The main goal is to trick the user into signing a transaction which will ultimately give the attacker control over the user’s tokens.\nUsually, it all starts with a tweet or a post on some Telegram group or Slack channel, where a link is sent advertising either a new yield farming protocol boasting large APYs, or a new NFT project which just started minting. In order to interact with the web site, the user would need to connect their wallet and perform some confirmation or authorization steps.\nLet’s take a look at the common NFT approve scam.

Some applications implement custom bootstrapping mechanisms, some are just meant to be dropped on the disk. However, in a typical enterprise environment, some form of control over the installed packages is often desired.

I can find a myriad of issues with any computer programming, but I also acknowledge the benefits of cyber innovation and the need to support new ideas, growth, and participation in the field. Digital Forensics and Incident Response focus on confirming malicious threats, identifying threat actors, and shedding the light on vulnerabilities. In this field of cyber investigation, I’ve come across the ‘smoking gun’ with fingerprints on it. You may not always know the name of the threat actor but it’s rewarding to discover the ‘fingerprint’ that identifies a threat or breach. At that moment, you better have your happy dance perfected!",

This research is especially relevant in the context of attacks on security researchers using backdoored Visual Studio projects allegedly by North Korean actors, as exposed by Google. We will show that these in-the-wild attacks are only the tip of the iceberg and that backdoors can be hidden via much stealthier vectors in Visual Studio projects.\nThis post will be a journey into COM, type libraries and the inner workings of Visual Studio. In particular, it serves the following goals:\nExploring Visual Studio’s attack surface for initial access attacks from a red teamer’s perspective.\nRaising awareness on the dangers of working with untrusted code, which we as hackers and security researchers do on a regular basis.\n\nRead full post\nThe post Attacking Visual Studio for Initial Access appeared first on Outflank.",
