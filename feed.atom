They patched both bugs along with several other Exchange vulnerabilities in the November Patch Tuesday release.
It is a beautiful chain, with an ingenious vector for gaining remote code execution. The tricky part is that it can be exploited in multiple ways, making both mitigation and detection harder. This blog post is divided into two main parts:

For November, Adobe released no patches at all. They’ve released as few as one in the past, but this is the first month in the last six years where they had no fixes at all.

A common task for admins is to reset users' passwords, which you can do with the GUI or PowerShell. However, in large networks, a self-service solution is required. Computer account passwords are another topic that administrators have to be familiar with.

Earlier this year, I discovered a surprising attack surface hidden deep inside Java’s standard library: A custom JIT compiler processing untrusted XSLT programs, exposed to remote attackers during XML signature verification. This post discusses CVE-2022-34169, an integer truncation bug in this JIT compiler resulting in arbitrary code execution in many Java-based web applications and identity providers that support the SAML single-sign-on standard. 
OpenJDK fixed the discussed issue in July 2022. The Apache BCEL project used by Xalan-J, the origin of the vulnerable code, released a patch in September 2022. 

While the vulnerability discussed in this post has been patched , vendors and users should expect further vulnerabilities in SAML.

I stumbled upon the Apache Batik library while researching other Java-based products. It immediately caught my attention, as this library parses Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files and transforms them into different raster graphics formats (i.e., PNG, PDF, or JPEG). I was even more encouraged when I looked at the Batik documentation. It was obvious that such a library could be prone to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) issues (e.g., loading of images from remote resources). However, the documentation shows that Batik can also:
·      Execute JavaScript through the Rhino interpreter.
·      Load and execute remote Java classes.
Those are some neat features! On the other hand, Apache Batik protects its users from both SSRF and remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities throug…]]></summary>

I've been spending a lot of time researching Windows authentication implementations, specifically Kerberos. In June 2022 I found an interesting issue number 2310 with the handling of RC4 encryption that allowed you to authenticate as another user if you could either interpose on the Kerberos network traffic to and from the KDC or directly if the user was configured to disable typical pre-authentication requirements.

This blog post goes into more detail on how this vulnerability works and how I was able to exploit it with only a bare minimum of brute forcing required. Note, I'm not going to spend time fully explaining how Kerberos authentication works, there's plenty of resources online.
