If you've not used ZAP before I suggest you look at some of the official tutorials first - ZAP home page, Videos. You can find my first part here OWASP ZAP and Web Sockets. The testing is being done against a small WebSockets based app I wrote called SocketToMe which has a few published services along with a few unpublished ones. In this article we are going to look at one of the published ones and try to identify some of the unpublished ones. The first feature I'll investigate is the number guessing game. Here the system picks a random number between 1 and 100 and you have to guess it. I'm going to cheat and see if I can get ZAP to play all 100 numbers for me to go for a quick win.]]></summary>

set up a GNS3 lab with RIPv1 and managed to exploit it by injecting a fake route
into the network. As a way to protect against this, RIPv2 can use authentication
to try to stop unauthorised routes being added to the system. From what I've
read, authentication was not added to RIPv2 as a security mechanism but as a way
to prevent routes from accidentally being added when incorrectly configured
routers are added to the network.

In this post I'll work through changing the lab from version 1 to version 2 and
then enabling the different levels of authentication. At each stage I will show
weaknesses in the system and ways to abuse them.]]></summary>

For my report I couldn't remember anything about the test, reading the report gave me some clues but I was really lucky and found that I'd left myself a test harness in the client's folder fully set up to test the vulnerability. One of the other two was testing for a vulnerability I'd never heard of and couldn't find anything about on Google. I finally tracked down the original tester and it turns out there is a simple tool which tests for the issue and one command line script later the retest was over. The final issue was one that I knew about but had a really good write up that, even if I'd not heard of it, had a full walk through on how to reproduce the test.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When doing reconnaissance on clients it is often useful to try to identify other websites or companies who are related to your target. One way to do this is to look at who is managing the Google Analytics traffic for them and then find who else they manage. There are a few online services which do this, the probably best known being ewhois, but whenever you use someone else's resources you are at their mercy over things like accuracy of the data and coverage, especially if you are working for a small client who hasn't been scanned by them then you won't get any results. This is where my tracker tracking tool comes in. The tool is in two parts, the first uses the power of the nmap engine to scan all the domains you are interested in and pull back tracking codes, these are then output in the standard nmap format along with the page title. I've then written a second script which takes the output and generates a grouped and sorted CSV file which you can then analyse.]]></summary>

I figured the best way to do this was to build a very simple application then throw in a proxy and see what happened. Unfortunately my proxy of choice, Burp Suite, currently doesn't handle WebSockets so I had to look for one that did. The only one, and this is their claim, that does in the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy, or ZAP for short. I'd been meaning to learn how to use it for a while so this seemed like the perfect opportunity. If anything in here is wrong, please get in touch and I'll fix it, I'm learning as I go along so may well be doing the odd thing wrong however it does all seem to work. I started by writing a small WebSocket based app which I called SocketToMe which has a few basic services, chat, a number guess game and a couple of other features. I figured I'd start with interception then have a look at fuzzing.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the first two parts of this dig into layer 2 I covered how to set up a lab using GNS3 and VirtualBox and then 
adding and interacting with VLANs. In this part I want to look at using Cisco's
Dynamic Trunking Protocol - DTP - to change the state of a port from access
mode to trunk mode to allow us to gain access all the VLANs on the network.

The previous link gives a more thorough overview of DTP but in summary, it is a protocol developed by Cisco to allow devices connected to a switch negotiate
whether they need their port to be in trunk or access mode. It is enabled by default on all ports so has to be deliberately disabled by an admin to turn it off.
Ports default to access mode leaving devices such as switches, which need a trunk port, to request it. A port can be changed from one state to the other
through a single DTP packet and there is no authentication, this makes it great as an attacker as you can easily switch your port to trunk mode on any switch
which has DTP enabled.]]></summary>

As with the VLAN labs I'm building this one in GNS3 and linking it to a Virtual Box machine running Debian. The plan is to build a network with three routers all using RIP to sync their routing information. I'll then use the attacking box to inject a fake route into the network and so divert traffic away from its real target. If you are not familiar with RIP it is hop based system where each hop is a unit and traffic is routed across the shortest number of hops.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Memory corruption vulnerabilities have been well known for a long time and programmers have developed various methods to prevent them. One type of memory corruption that is very hard to prevent is the use-after-free and the reason is that it has too many faces! Since it cannot be associated with any specific pattern in source code, it is not trivial to eliminate this vulnerability class. In this blog, a use-after-free vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox will be explained which has been assigned CVE-2022-26381. The Mozilla bug entry 1756793 is still closed to the public as of this writing, but the Zero Day Initiative advisory page ZDI-22-502 can provide a bit more information.

When reading through some of the features of the Rubeus tool I realised that there was a possible way of abusing Kerberos to bypass UAC, well on domain joined systems at least. It's unclear if this has been documented before, this post seems to discuss something similar but relies on doing the UAC bypass from another system, but what I'm going to describe works locally. Even if it has been described as a technique before I'm not sure it's been documented how it works under the hood.

In this article, we’ll show you some great techniques for getting much more out of your arbitrary file deletes, arbitrary folder deletes, and other seemingly low-impact filesystem-based exploit primitives.
The Trouble with Arbitrary File Deletes
When you consider how to leverage an arbitrary file delete on Windows, two great obstacles present themselves:
Most critical Windows OS files are locked down with DACLs that prevent modification even by SYSTEM. Instead, most OS files are owned by TrustedInstaller, and only that account has permission to modify them.
