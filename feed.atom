        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we debuted OST back in 2021, we wrote a blog detailing both the product features and the rationale for investing time into this toolset. In 2022, we joined forces with Fortra and we can hardly believe it’s been over a year already. It was a big decision to go from being a small team of red teamers to becoming part of a large company, but we’re very pleased with the switch. In this reflection on the past 12 months, we want to provide an update on our mission, detail our continued dedication to OST, discuss the process of growing the Outflank community, and touch on where we’re headed next.  
A Product Oriented Focus
One of our biggest challenges when we joined Fortra was the decision to put most of our energy into Outflank Security Tooling (OST).

We’re back with an exciting update on Session Hijacking Visual Exploitation (SHVE) that introduces an insidious twist to traditional exploitation techniques using Office documents. We all know how Office documents laced with macros have been a longstanding entry point for infiltrating systems. SHVE now takes a step further by leveraging XSS vulnerabilities and the inherent trust users have in websites they regularly visit.
Our newest feature integrates the concept of Office document poisoning. Here’s how it works: SHVE allows you to upload templates for .docm, .pptm, and .xslm formats. Whenever a victim of SHVE goes to download one of these document types, the tool will automatically intercept and inject the malicious macros into the file before it is downloaded.

Though it is included in the OWASP Top 10 list of web application security risks, at times vendors tend to downplay it and not treat it seriously.
As usual, the truth lies somewhere in between. What appears to be SSRF may sometimes in fact be intended functionality. Even so, an attacker may be able to abuse that functionality to improperly disclose sensitive information, either from the application containing the SSRF or from unrelated internal systems.
