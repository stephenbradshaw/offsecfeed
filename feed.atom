        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Researching and reverse engineering Level 2 Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE or loosely “charger”) efforts might require the equipment to be placed beyond the idle state. The idle state is straightforward and usually involves nothing more than powering up the charger. Indeed, this is a very useful state for research where the user interface is in operation, communications both wired and wireless are working and the mobile device app can interact. However, there are times when there is a need to force the charger into other states so that it behaves as though the electric vehicle is attached, the EV is asking for charge, or the EV is charging and the EVSE is providing charging current.

This involves mounting the virtual disk and installing updates through PowerShell. This approach also benefits VMs that have been powered off for an extended period. Instead of starting them in an outdated and potentially vulnerable state, you can apply critical security updates in advance.

Introduction
I know, we have written it multiple times now, but in case you are just tuning in, Doyensec had found themselves on a cruise ship touring the Mediterranean for our company retreat. To kill time between parties, we had some hacking sessions analyzing real-world vulnerabilities resulting in the !exploitable blogpost series.
In Part 1 we covered our journey into IoT ARM exploitation, while Part 2 followed our attempts to exploit the bug used by Trinity in The Matrix Reloaded movie.
For this episode, we will dive into the exploitation of CVE-2024-0402 in GitLab. Like an onion, there is always another layer beneath the surface of this bug, from YAML parser differentials to path traversal in decompression functions in order to achieve arbitrary file …]]></summary>

The standout addition is the Dispatch mode, which I prefer to call reasoning mode, enabling administrators to plan complex automation tasks with AI assistance. Prompt Suggestions might better be described as big brother or creepy mode since the AI continually observes your actions and intervenes when it believes you need assistance. Additionally, AI memory functions similarly to the personalization feature in ChatGPT, allowing you to save preferences as Knowledge across sessions.

This bug was originally discovered by k0shl and Wei in Kunlun Lab with Cyber KunLun. Successful exploitation could result in arbitrary code execution in the security context of the target service. The following is a portion of their write-up covering CVE-2024-43639, with a few minimal modifications.
An integer overflow has been reported for Microsoft Windows KDC Proxy. The vulnerability is due to a missing check for Kerberos response length.

Introduction
In case you are just tuning in, Doyensec has found themselves on a
cruse ship touring the Mediterranean. Unwinding, hanging out with colleagues and having
some fun. Part 1 covered our journey into IoT ARM exploitation, while our next blog post, coming in the next couple weeks, will cover a web target. For this episode, we attempt to exploit one of the most famous vulnerabilities ever. SSHNuke from back in 2001. Better known as the exploit used by Trinity in the movie The Matrix Reloaded.



Some Quick History
Back in 1998 Ariel Futoransky and Emiliano Kargieman realized SSH’s protocol
was fundamentally flawed, as it was possible to inject cipher text. So a crc32
checksum was added in order to detect this attack.
