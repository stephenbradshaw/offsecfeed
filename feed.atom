        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this article, you will learn how to enable two-factor authentication for SSH in Linux. Secure Shell (or SSH) is primarily used by admins to securely access and manage remote computers, particularly those running Linux. It supports two very common forms of authentication: password authentication and public key authentication. It is always recommended to use public key authentication for SSH access since it is more secure. However, if you still depend on password authentication, it is highly recommended to enable two-factor authentication.

In modern browser architecture design, compromising the renderer gets us just half the way there, since the sandbox prevents further damage. In this blog post, we discuss a second prototype pollution vulnerability that allowed the execution of attacker-controlled JavaScript in the privileged parent process, escaping the sandbox. This vulnerability is known as CVE-2022-1529 and is tracked as ZDI-22-798 on the Zero Day Initiative advisory page. Mozilla fixed this vulnerability along with the first one in Firefox 100.0.2 via Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2022-19.

Typically this involves either a direct error in memory management or a way to corrupt internal object state in the JavaScript engine. One way to eliminate such memory safety issues is to use a memory-safe language such as Rust or even JavaScript itself. At Pwn2Own Vancouver 2022, Manfred Paul compromised the Mozilla Firefox browser using a full chain exploit that broke the mold. Although his exploit used some memory corruptions, the vulnerable code was written in a memory-safe programming language: JavaScript!

Our standard 120-day disclosure timeline for most vulnerabilities remains, but for bug reports that result from faulty or incomplete patches, we will use a shorter timeline. Moving forward, the ZDI will adopt a tiered approach based on the severity of the bug and the efficacy of the original fix. The first tier will be a 30-day timeframe for most Critical-rated cases where exploitation is detected or expected. The second level will be a 60-day interval for Critical- and High-severity bugs where the patch offers some protections. Finally, there will be a 90-day period for other severities where no imminent exploitation is expected. As with our normal timelines, extensions will be limited and granted on a case…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the last few years, multiple VMware ESXi remote, unauthenticated code execution vulnerabilities have been publicly disclosed. Some were also found to be exploited in the wild. Since these bugs were found in ESXi’s implementation of the SLP service, VMware provided workarounds to turn off the service. VMware also disabled the service by default starting with ESX 7.0 Update 2c. In this blog post, we explore another remotely reachable attack surface: ESXi’s TCP/IP stack implemented as a VMkernel module. The most interesting outcome of this analysis is that ESXi’s TCP/IP stack is based on FreeBSD 8.2 and does not include security patches for the vulnerabilities disclosed over the years since that release of FreeBSD. 
This result also prompted us to analyze the nature of vulnerabilities di…]]></summary>
