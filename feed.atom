Some were also found to be exploited in the wild. Since these bugs were found in ESXi’s implementation of the SLP service, VMware provided workarounds to turn off the service. VMware also disabled the service by default starting with ESX 7.0 Update 2c. In this blog post, we explore another remotely reachable attack surface: ESXi’s TCP/IP stack implemented as a VMkernel module. The most interesting outcome of this analysis is that ESXi’s TCP/IP stack is based on FreeBSD 8.2 and does not include security patches for the vulnerabilities disclosed over the years since that release of FreeBSD.
