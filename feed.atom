        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
At Doyensec, we decided to perform a vulnerability research activity on the SMB3 Kernel Server (ksmbd), a component of the Linux kernel. Initially, it was enabled as an experimental feature, but in the kernel version 6.6, the experimental flag was removed, and it remains stable.
Ksmbd splits tasks to optimize performance, handling critical file operations in kernel space and non-performance-related tasks, such as DCE/RPC and user account management, in user space via ksmbd.mountd. The server uses a multi-threaded architecture to efficiently process SMB requests in parallel, leveraging kernel worker threads for scalability and user-space integration for configuration and RPC handling.
Ksmbd is not enabled by default, but it is a great target for learning the SMB protocol while …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my previous blog post, I demonstrated how a JSON file could be used as a gadget for Client-Side Path Traversal (CSPT) to perform Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). That example was straightforward because no file upload restriction was enforced. However, real-world applications often impose restrictions on file uploads to ensure security.
In this post, we’ll explore how to bypass some of these mechanisms to achieve the same goal. We’ll cover common file validation methods and how they can be subverted.
Constraint
In most scenarios, the gadget file will be parsed in the front-end using JSON.parse.
It means that our file must be a valid input for JSON.parse.
If we look at the V8 implementation. A valid JSON input is :
a string
a number

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not long ago, we used to "google" to find information online. With the rise of chatbots incorporating web search capabilities, a new phrase is becoming popular: "to chat it." 4sysops AI now utilizes Google or Tavily search to help solve your IT challenges. Initially, the AI determines the most effective search terms for your query. It subsequently reviews all the pages returned by the search engine to provide an answer tailored to your specific question, drawing from the retrieved context, its stored knowledge, and the entirety of your previous conversation. The model then provides links to the sources used to generate its answers, allowing you to verify any response. Whether you're still "googling" or ChatGPT Search has become your preferred answering machine, continue reading to discover why 4sysops AI, combined with integrated web search, is the best AI tool for addressing IT issues.

The SALT (Small Model Aided Large Model Training) method uses smaller models to guide the initial training phase of larger models through knowledge distillation (KD). SALTDS (SALT with Data Selection) extends this technique by identifying and prioritizing challenging but learnable training sequences for knowledge transfer during the KD phase.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As 2024 nears its end, we feel it is a great time to look back at what we achieved in 2024.
TLDR: No one would call this a quiet year for Outflank.
OST Releases: New Tools and Major Releases
22 releases! We managed to put out 22 releases of OST in 2024.
Rapid development remains a cornerstone of OST and has allowed us to match the pace of evolving threat landscape to deliver cutting edge tools and capabilities. We have a release note tracker covering every release, but highlights include:
EDR Presets
With EDRs becoming more powerful, and bypasses requiring more EDR-specific tricks, it was becoming hard to keep track of the countless options OST operators have for evasion of those EDRs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Tesla Wall Connector is a Level 2 electric vehicle charge station designed for use by residential home users. The device has a minimal user interface in its hardware, providing a Wi-Fi based interface for configuration and an NFC reader for user authentication. The device does not come with a dedicated mobile application out of the box; the initial configuration—which is rather minimal—is performed via the web interface. After that, the device suggests the Tesla One app is to be used for further configuration. The Tesla app allows connecting to the device but apparently can only be used to perform a few functions such as scheduled charging and viewing information about the device. It does not offer options for further configuration.

This update streamlines transferring virtual machines from other hypervisors to your Proxmox setup. However, the Import Wizard introduced in Proxmox 8.2 is likely a more suitable choice for migrating VMware VMs to Proxmox. This post details how to export and import an Oracle VirtualBox VM into Proxmox using the new OVA import feature.

During my recent internship with Doyensec, I had the opportunity to research decompression attacks across different programming languages. As the use of archive file formats is widespread in software development, it is crucial for developers to understand the potential security risks involved in handling these files.
The objective of my research was to identify, analyze, and detect vulnerable implementations in several popular programming languages used for web and app development, including Python, Ruby, Swift, Java, PHP, and JavaScript. These languages have libraries for archive decompression that, when used improperly, may potentially lead to vulnerabilities.
To demonstrate the risk of unsafe unpacking, I created proof-of-concept (PoC) code with different vulnerable impleme…]]></summary>

The first submissions we received were from Sina Kheirkhah (@SinSinology), and one of those was a pre-auth RCE based on the .NET Remoting service. After his issues were patched, we received some additional, anonymous reports, in which pre-auth RCE was achieved via an unauthenticated gRPC/.NET Remoting based service on port 55555/tcp.
