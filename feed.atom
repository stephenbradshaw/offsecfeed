Interested readers can check our previous blog posts about vulnerabilities across interfaces such as RDPMC hypercalls, the Parallels ToolGate, and the VGA virtual device. This post explores another set of issues we received last year - local privilege escalations through setuid root binaries.
Parallels Desktop has a couple of setuid binaries: prl_update_helper and Parallels Service. Both binaries run with root privileges and both invoke bash scripts to run commands with the privileges of root. For such use cases, bash specifically provides a privileged mode using the “-p” flag. Parallels Desktop prior to version 18.1.0 does not take advantage of bash privileged mode, nor do…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If Windows doesn't start or boot, you need a good repair tool that you allows to access the boot drive to rescue your Windows installation by recovering partitions, copying files, or resetting the admin password. SystemRescue is a collection of open-source utilities on a bootable ISO image, making it easy to download and mount directly to a virtual machine or "burn" to a USB drive. You can use them for both Linux and Windows computers, including desktops, laptops, and servers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this blog post we will demonstrate how compiling, reverse engineering or even just viewing source code can lead to compromise of a developer’s workstation. This research is especially relevant in the context of attacks on security researchers using backdoored Visual Studio projects allegedly by North Korean actors, as exposed by Google. We will show that these in-the-wild attacks are only the tip of the iceberg and that backdoors can be hidden via much stealthier vectors in Visual Studio projects.
This post will be a journey into COM, type libraries and the inner workings of Visual Studio. In particular, it serves the following goals:
Exploring Visual Studio’s attack surface for initial access attacks from a red teamer’s perspective.
Raising awareness on the dangers of working with untrusted code, which we as hackers and security researchers do on a regular basis.

A large number of today’s crypto scams involve some sort of phishing attack, where the user is tricked into visiting a shady/malicious web site and connecting their wallet to it. The main goal is to trick the user into signing a transaction which will ultimately give the attacker control over the user’s tokens.
Usually, it all starts with a tweet or a post on some Telegram group or Slack channel, where a link is sent advertising either a new yield farming protocol boasting large APYs, or a new NFT project which just started minting. In order to interact with the web site, the user would need to connect their wallet and perform some confirmation or authorization steps.

With the advent of new technologies and a rapidly evolving threat landscape, defending against cyber attacks has become more challenging than ever before. We recently presented on the evolution of software security threats and defense strategies at the Security Summit in Milan on 15th March 2023. In this blog post, we'll explore some of the key takeaways from the presentation.
In the early 1990s, the Internet was still in its infancy, and most people accessed it through their workstations or personal computers. Security threats were relatively simple, and malware and viruses were typically spread through floppy disks or infected email attachments. As the Internet became more ubiquitous, so did the security threats. In the early…]]></summary>
