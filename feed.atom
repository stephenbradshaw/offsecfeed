This bug was originally submitted to the ZDI program by an anonymous researcher. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Similar bugs are reported as being exploited in the wild. The following is a portion of their write-up covering CVE-2023-24941, with a few minimal modifications.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, I had the privilege to write a detailed analysis of CVE-2023-34362, which is series of several vulnerabilities in the MOVEit file transfer application that lead to remote code execution. One of the several vulnerabilities involved an ISAPI module - specifically, the MoveITISAPI.dll ISAPI extension. One of the many vulnerabilities that comprised the MOVEit RCE was a header-injection issue, where the ISAPI application parsed headers differently than the .net application. This point is going to dig into how to analyze and reverse engineer an ISAPI-based service! This wasn’t the first time in the recent past I’d had to work on something written as an ISAPI module, and each time I feel like I have to start over and remember how it’s supposed to work. This time, I thought I’d combine my hastily-scrawled notes with some Googling, and try to write something that I (and others) can use in the future. As such, this will be a quick intro to ISAPI applications from the angle that matters to me - how to reverse engineer and debug them! I want to preface this with: I’m not a Windows developer, and I’ve never run an IIS server on purpose. That means that I am approaching this with brute-force ignorance! I don’t have a lot of background context nor do I know the correct terminology for a lot of this stuff. Instead, I’m going to treat these are typical DLLs from typical applications, and approach them as such.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year we published our patch gap analysis of ESXi’s TCP/IP stack, which is forked from FreeBSD 8.2. While our focus was mainly on missing FreeBSD patches in ESXi, we also came across a type confusion bug in code introduced by VMware. This blog post details a vulnerability I discovered in ESXi’s implementation of the setsockopt system call that could lead to a sandbox escape. The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2022-31696 and disclosed as part of the advisory VMSA-2022-003. Additionally, I also explore ESXi’s kernel heap allocator and weaknesses in existing kernel mitigations. 
For information regarding the initial analysis of the TCP/IP kernel module, VMkernel debug symbols, and porting type information from FreeBSD to ESXi, it is recommend to read our earlier analysis.

The challenge for the AWS Cognito CloudSecTidbit is basically escalating the privileges to admin and reading the internal users list.
The application uses AWS Cognito to issue a session token saved as a cookie with the name aws-cognito-app-access-token.
The JWT is a valid AWS Cognito user token, usable to interact with the service.
It is possible to retrieve the current user attributes with the command:

aws cognito-idp get-user --region us-east-1 --access-token <USER_ACCESS_TOKEN>
