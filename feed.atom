        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Endpoints such as laptops, desktops, and mobile devices are vulnerable to cyberattacks, which can compromise sensitive data and cause serious damage to the organization. To address this challenge, Microsoft has developed Intune Endpoint Privilege Management, a solution that enables organizations to secure their endpoints by controlling and managing user access and permissions. This blog post aims to assist you in setting up Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) in your organization so that your users can maintain their productivity while ensuring that security is not compromised.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the purpose of securing Microsoft Office installs we see many of our customers moving to a macro signing strategy. Furthermore, Microsoft is trying to battle macro malware by enforcing Mark-of-the-Web (MotW) control on macro-enabled documents. In this blog we will dive into some of the quirks of Microsoft Office macro security, various commonly used configuration options and their bypasses.
In the first part of the blog we will discuss various Microsoft Office security controls on macros and add-ins, including their subtleties, pitfalls and offensive bypasses. 
In the second part of this blog the concept of LOLdocs is further explained, detailing how vulnerabilities in signed MS Office content might be abused to bypass even strictly configured MS Office installs.
This blog is related to our BruCON talk on LOLdocs: legitimately signed Office documents where control flows can be hijacked for malicious purposes.

However, if you are using this in a URL, it’s pretty hard to do anything too complicated since it expands the text to the point where web servers won’t accept the URL anymore (8190 characters is default max in Apache).
So I used this:
<?=`$_GET[0]`?>

From: https://github.com/bayufedra/Tiny-PHP-Webshell
Which resulted in the following 3036 character URI ending in a &0=ls which executed the command ls:

Interested readers can check our previous blog posts about vulnerabilities across interfaces such as RDPMC hypercalls, the Parallels ToolGate, and the VGA virtual device. This post explores another set of issues we received last year - local privilege escalations through setuid root binaries.
Parallels Desktop has a couple of setuid binaries: prl_update_helper and Parallels Service. Both binaries run with root privileges and both invoke bash scripts to run commands with the privileges of root. For such use cases, bash specifically provides a privileged mode using the “-p” flag. Parallels Desktop prior to version 18.1.0 does not take advantage of bash privileged mode, nor do…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We often take for granted that things just work without considering how we got to where we are now. It’s easy to complain. I can find a myriad of issues with any computer programming, but I also acknowledge the benefits of cyber innovation and the need to support new ideas, growth, and participation in the field. Digital Forensics and Incident Response focus on confirming malicious threats, identifying threat actors, and shedding the light on vulnerabilities. In this field of cyber investigation, I’ve come across the ‘smoking gun’ with fingerprints on it. You may not always know the name of the threat actor but it’s rewarding to discover the ‘fingerprint’ that identifies a threat or breach. At that moment, you better have your happy dance perfected!]]></summary>
