Recently, for Linux Kernel exploitation reasons, I’ve been very interested in Nyx. Nyx is a KVM-based hypervisor fuzzer that you can use to snapshot fuzz traditionally hard to fuzz targets. A lot of the time (most of the time?), we want to fuzz things that don’t naturally lend themselves well to traditional fuzzing approaches. When faced with target complexity in fuzzing (leaving input generation and nuance aside for now), there have generally been two approaches.]]></summary>

We’re back with an exciting update on Session Hijacking Visual Exploitation (SHVE) that introduces an insidious twist to traditional exploitation techniques using Office documents. We all know how Office documents laced with macros have been a longstanding entry point for infiltrating systems. SHVE now takes a step further by leveraging XSS vulnerabilities and the inherent trust users have in websites they regularly visit.
Our newest feature integrates the concept of Office document poisoning. Here’s how it works: SHVE allows you to upload templates for .docm, .pptm, and .xslm formats. Whenever a victim of SHVE goes to download one of these document types, the tool will automatically intercept and inject the malicious macros into the file before it is downloaded.

Though it is included in the OWASP Top 10 list of web application security risks, at times vendors tend to downplay it and not treat it seriously.
As usual, the truth lies somewhere in between. What appears to be SSRF may sometimes in fact be intended functionality. Even so, an attacker may be able to abuse that functionality to improperly disclose sensitive information, either from the application containing the SSRF or from unrelated internal systems.
You may have noticed battles between researchers and vendors where an SSRF vulnerability was at the center of the disagreement. The fun part starts when a single vendor responds to different…]]></summary>

The number of Android applications has been growing rapidly in recent years. In 2022, there were over 3.55 million Android apps available in the Google Play Store, and this number is expected to continue to grow in the years to come. The expansion of the Android app market is being driven by a number of factors, including the increasing popularity of smartphones, the growing demand for mobile apps, and the ease of developing and publishing Android apps. At the same time, the number of Android app
 downloads is also growing rapidly. In 2022, there were over 255 billion Android app downloads worldwide.

This post will teach you about Kubernetes init containers. A Kubernetes init container is a special type of container that runs before the main application container in a Pod. The init containers can be used to perform tasks such as setting up the environment, pulling code or a binary from a repository, downloading dependencies, or running scripts that are not part of the container image. You can use an init container to wait for other services, such as a database, to come up before the main app container starts. Essentially, init containers are used to get things ready for your app containers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Windows, named pipes are a form of interprocess communication (IPC) that allows processes to communicate with one another, both locally and across the network. Named pipes serve as a mechanism to transfer data between Windows components as well as third-party applications and services. Both locally as well as on a domain. From an offensive perspective, named pipes may leak some information that could be useful for reconnaissance purposes. Since named pipes can also be used (depending on configuration) to access services remotely – they could allow remote exploits (MS08-067).
In this post we will explore how named pipes can be listed remotely in offensive operations, for example via an implant running on a compromised Windows system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In May 2023, we received a vulnerability report from an anonymous researcher regarding a vulnerability in Apple Safari. It turned out to be an interesting classic integer underflow vulnerability. Apple assigned CVE-2023-38600 to this issue and fixed it in the following security advisories:
— iOS 16.6 and iPadOS 16.6 
— macOS Ventura 13.5 
— tvOS 16.6
— Safari 16.6 
— watchOS 9.6 
 Now that this vulnerability has been addressed by the vendor, we are ready to share additional details with the community.
Proof of Concept
Here is the minimal proof-of-concept code for this bug:
Let’s break it down quickly:  
     1 -    A new ArrayBuffer object of size 0x1000 is created. Note that it is resizable as it specifies maxByteLength.
     2 -    The ArrayBuffer object created at step 1 is used to crea…]]></summary>
