With number matching, a number is displayed to a user when they sign in, and instead of entering this number on the device, they log in to confirm the number on the MFA device. Temporary Access Pass is another feature that allows you to help end users who are unable to meet sign-in criteria.

It was originally submitted to the ZDI program by the researcher known as “DA-0x43-Dx4-DA-Hx2-Tx2-TP-S-Q from GTSC”. After successful validation, it was immediately submitted to Microsoft. They patched both bugs along with several other Exchange vulnerabilities in the November Patch Tuesday release.
It is a beautiful chain, with an ingenious vector for gaining remote code execution. The tricky part is that it can be exploited in multiple ways, making both mitigation and detection harder. This blog post is divided into two main parts:

Adobe Patches for November 2022
For November, Adobe released no patches at all. They’ve released as few as one in the past, but this is the first month in the last six years where they had no fixes at all. Perhaps the U.S. elections play a factor, as Patch Tuesday hasn’t fallen on Election Day since 2016. Whatever the cause, enjoy a month of no Adobe updates.

As defenders, in-the-wild exploit samples give us important insight into what attackers are really doing. We get the “ground truth” data about the vulnerabilities and exploit techniques they’re using, which then informs our further research and guidance to security teams on what could have the biggest impact or return on investment. To do this, we need to know that the vulnerabilities and exploit samples were found in-the-wild. Over the past few years there’s been tremendo…]]></summary>

Earlier this year, I discovered a surprising attack surface hidden deep inside Java’s standard library: A custom JIT compiler processing untrusted XSLT programs, exposed to remote attackers during XML signature verification. This post discusses CVE-2022-34169, an integer truncation bug in this JIT compiler resulting in arbitrary code execution in many Java-based web applications and identity providers that support the SAML single-sign-on standard. 
OpenJDK fixed the discussed issue in July 2022. The Apache BCEL project used by Xalan-J, the origin of the vulnerable code, released a patch in September 2022. 

While the vulnerability discussed in this post has been patched , vendors and users should expect further vulnerabilities in SAML.

Instead of needing administrator privileges, UAC allows admins to set up standard user permissions for users and escalate privileges in a granular way. In corporate networks, admins can use Group Policy to configure various UAC settings, including disabling UAC. Thanks to Windows Hello, you can now use a PIN for UAC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
I stumbled upon the Apache Batik library while researching other Java-based products. It immediately caught my attention, as this library parses Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files and transforms them into different raster graphics formats (i.e., PNG, PDF, or JPEG). I was even more encouraged when I looked at the Batik documentation. It was obvious that such a library could be prone to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) issues (e.g., loading of images from remote resources). However, the documentation shows that Batik can also:
·      Execute JavaScript through the Rhino interpreter.
·      Load and execute remote Java classes.
Those are some neat features! On the other hand, Apache Batik protects its users from both SSRF and remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities throug…]]></summary>
