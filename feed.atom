        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
Prototype pollution has recently emerged as a fashionable vulnerability within the realm of web security. This vulnerability occurs when an attacker exploits the nature of JavaScript’s prototype inheritance to modify a prototype of an object. By doing so, they can inject malicious code or alter an application to behave in unintended ways. This could potentially lead to sensitive information leakage, type confusion vulnerabilities, or even remote code execution, under certain conditions.
For those interested in diving deeper into the technicalities and impacts of prototype pollution, we recommend checking out PortSwigger’s comprehensive guide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction If you haven’t heard, we’re developing a fuzzer on the blog these days. I don’t even know if “fuzzer” is the right word for what we’re building, it’s almost more like an execution engine that will expose hooks? Anyways, if you missed the first episode you can catch up here. We are creating a fuzzer that loads a statically built Bochs emulator into itself, and executes Bochs logic while maintaining a sandbox for Bochs. You can think of it as, we were too lazy to implement our own x86_64 emulator from scratch so we’ve just literally taken a complete emulator and stuffed it into our own process to use it. The fuzzer is written in Rust and Bochs is a C++ codebase. Bochs is a full system emulator, so the devices and everything else is just simulated in software. This is great for us because we can simply snapshot and restore Bochs itself to achieve snapshot fuzzing of our target. So the fuzzer runs Bochs and Bochs runs our target. This allows us to snapshot fuzz arbitrarily complex targets: web browsers, kernels, network stacks, etc. This episode, we’ll delve into the concept of sandboxing Bochs from syscalls. We do not want Bochs to be capable of escaping its sandbox or retrieving any data from outside of our environment. So today we’ll get into the implementation details of my first stab at Bochs-to-fuzzer context switching to handle syscalls. In the future we will also need to implement context switching from fuzzer-to-Bochs as well, but for now let’s focus on syscalls.]]></summary>

C:\> sudo powershell.exe

The first thing to note, if you know anything about the security model of Windows (maybe buy my book, hint hint), is that there's no equivalent to SUID binaries. The only way to run a process with a higher privilege level is to get an existing higher privileged process to start it for you or you have sufficient permissions yourself though say SeImpersonatePrivilege or S…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To execute .NET post-exploitation tools safely, operators may want to modify certain managed functions. For example, some C# tools use the .NET standard library to terminate their process after execution. This may not be an issue for fork&run implementations that spawn a sacrificial process, but executing in-process will terminate an implant. One could write a small .NET program that resolves and patches these functions, but we were interested in an unmanaged approach (i.e. a unmanaged implant executing managed code in-process). While our example targets System.Environment.Exit, a similar technique should work for any managed function.

In January 2022, I uploaded a functional example of this approach to my personal GitHub. However, the implementation was a part of a larger project, and I’ve received a few questions about the technique, so I created this standalone example and writeup.
