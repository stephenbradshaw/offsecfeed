The bug was reported through the ZDI program and later patched by Microsoft. Marcin has graciously provided this detailed write-up of the vulnerability, examines how it could be exploited, and a look at the patch Microsoft released to address the bug.
In the Windows kernel, there are three APIs intended for general use by device drivers for the purpose of creating bitmaps: EngCreateBitmap, EngCreateDeviceBitmap and EngCreateDeviceSurface. Each of these APIs return a bitmap handle. If the caller wants to perform some drawing operations on the bitmap, the caller must first lock the bitmap by passing its handle to EngLockSurface.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a previous post, you learned about node selectors and node affinity in Kubernetes. In this post, we will discuss the ConfigMap resource that allows you to store data as a dictionary (using key–value pairs) outside of your containerization applications. It offers a means of storing configuration information, environment variables, command-line arguments, or other configuration data that Pods or other Kubernetes objects can use during their execution. This approach makes your applications more portable, flexible, and easier to maintain since the configuration settings are stored and maintained independently of specific Pods.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction I’ve been doing some Linux kernel exploit development/study and vulnerability research off and on since last Fall and a few months ago I had some downtime on vacation to sit and challenge myself to write my first data-only exploit for a real bug that was exploited in kCTF. io_ring has been a popular target in the program’s history up to this point, so I thought I’d find an easy-to-reason-about bug there that had already been exploited as fertile ground for exploit development creativity. The bug I chose to work with was one which resulted in a struct file UAF where it was possible to hold an open file descriptor to the freed object. There have been quite a few write-ups on file UAF exploits, so I decided as a challenge that my exploit had to be data-only. The parameters of the self-imposed challenge were completely arbitrary, but I just wanted to try writing an exploit that didn’t rely on hijacking control flow. I have written quite a few Linux kernel exploits of real kCTF bugs at this point, probably 5-6 as practice, just starting with the vulnerability and going from there, but all of them have ended up in me using ROP, so this was my first try at data-only. I also had not seen a data-only exploit for a struct file UAF yet, which was encouraging as it seemed it was worthwile “research”. Also, before we get too far, please do not message me to tell me that someone already did xyz years prior. I’m very new to this type of thing and was just doing this as a personal challenge, if some aspects of the exploit are unoriginal, that is by coincidence. I will do my best to cite all my inspiration as we go.]]></summary>
