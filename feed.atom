However, if you are using this in a URL, it’s pretty hard to do anything too complicated since it expands the text to the point where web servers won’t accept the URL anymore (8190 characters is default max in Apache).
So I used this:
<?=`$_GET[0]`?>

From: https://github.com/bayufedra/Tiny-PHP-Webshell
Which resulted in the following 3036 character URI ending in a &0=ls which executed the command ls:

With little over a month of research time assigned and few targets to look at, NCC Group decided to remove the flash memory and extract the firmware using a programmer, firmware which we (correctly) assumed would be stored unencrypted. This allowed us to bypass the firmware update package encryption. With the firmware extracted, the binaries could be reverse-engineered to find vulnerabilities that would allow remote code execution.]]></summary>

Digital Forensics and Incident Response focus on confirming malicious threats, identifying threat actors, and shedding the light on vulnerabilities. In this field of cyber investigation, I’ve come across the ‘smoking gun’ with fingerprints on it. You may not always know the name of the threat actor but it’s rewarding to discover the ‘fingerprint’ that identifies a threat or breach.

Let me show you how to do the latter with the help of AccessEnum, a GUI tool from the Sysinternals Suite.

This research is especially relevant in the context of attacks on security researchers using backdoored Visual Studio projects allegedly by North Korean actors, as exposed by Google. We will show that these in-the-wild attacks are only the tip of the iceberg and that backdoors can be hidden via much stealthier vectors in Visual Studio projects.
This post will be a journey into COM, type libraries and the inner workings of Visual Studio. In particular, it serves the following goals:
Exploring Visual Studio’s attack surface for initial access attacks from a red teamer’s perspective.
Raising awareness on the dangers of working with untrusted code, which we as hackers and security researchers do on a regular basis.

A large number of today’s crypto scams involve some sort of phishing attack, where the user is tricked into visiting a shady/malicious web site and connecting their wallet to it. The main goal is to trick the user into signing a transaction which will ultimately give the attacker control over the user’s tokens.
Usually, it all starts with a tweet or a post on some Telegram group or Slack channel, where a link is sent advertising either a new yield farming protocol boasting large APYs, or a new NFT project which just started minting. In order to interact with the web site, the user would need to connect their wallet and perform some confirmation or authorization steps.

In this blog post, we'll explore some of the key takeaways from the presentation.
In the early 1990s, the Internet was still in its infancy, and most people accessed it through their workstations or personal computers. Security threats were relatively simple, and malware and viruses were typically spread through floppy disks or infected email attachments.
