It enables AI agents to make informed decisions to perform tasks autonomously. Given that Anthropic's announcement is just a few weeks old, the number of available MCP servers is impressive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OAuth2’s popularity makes it a prime target for attackers. While it simplifies user login, its complexity can lead to misconfigurations that create security holes. Some of the more intricate vulnerabilities keep reappearing because the protocol’s inner workings are not always well-understood. In an effort to change that, we have decided to write a comprehensive guide on known attacks against OAuth implementations. Additionally, we have created a comprehensive checklist. It should prove useful for testers and developers alike to quickly assess whether their implementation is secure.

Today's post features a sample script that monitors a server and alerts the admin if any issues arise. Linux and its applications are incredibly reliable. However, a rogue script running into an infinite loop might deplete resources, disrupting services. In such cases, you can automate the restart of services with a Bash script, and if that fails, automatically reboot the server.

The Cline extension for Visual Studio Code is a significant step in this direction, allowing you to create scripts using natural language, execute them with AI support in the terminal, and rely on AI to analyze shell output and respond to errors. While the extension supports various shells, I'll demonstrate how to utilize Cline to automate PowerShell administration.

In this post we aim to outline the threat landscape of the XAV-AX8500 in the hopes of providing inspiration for vulnerability research.
We will cover the main supported technologies that present potential attack surfaces such as USB, Bluetooth, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, and more. We will also look at some of the open-source components the XAV-AX8500 claims to use.
All information has been obtained through reverse engineering, experimenting, and combing through the following resources:

This blog post presents internal photos of the XAV-AX8500 boards and highlights each of the interesting components.
Internals
Accessing the internals of the XAV-AX8500 involves removing a few screws and metal plates. Once the main chassis is open 3 interconnected boards are exposed that are connected via flat flexible cables. The main board is shown below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my previous blog post, I demonstrated how a JSON file could be used as a gadget for Client-Side Path Traversal (CSPT) to perform Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). That example was straightforward because no file upload restriction was enforced. However, real-world applications often impose restrictions on file uploads to ensure security.
In this post, we’ll explore how to bypass some of these mechanisms to achieve the same goal. We’ll cover common file validation methods and how they can be subverted.
Constraint
In most scenarios, the gadget file will be parsed in the front-end using JSON.parse.
It means that our file must be a valid input for JSON.parse.
If we look at the V8 implementation. A valid JSON input is :
a string
a number
true
false

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
At Doyensec, we decided to perform a vulnerability research activity on the SMB3 Kernel Server (ksmbd), a component of the Linux kernel. Initially, it was enabled as an experimental feature, but in the kernel version 6.6, the experimental flag was removed, and it remains stable.
Ksmbd splits tasks to optimize performance, handling critical file operations in kernel space and non-performance-related tasks, such as DCE/RPC and user account management, in user space via ksmbd.mountd. The server uses a multi-threaded architecture to efficiently process SMB requests in parallel, leveraging kernel worker threads for scalability and user-space integration for configuration and RPC handling.
Ksmbd is not enabled by default, but it is a great target for learning the SMB protocol while …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my previous blog post, I demonstrated how a JSON file could be used as a gadget for Client-Side Path Traversal (CSPT) to perform Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). That example was straightforward because no file upload restriction was enforced. However, real-world applications often impose restrictions on file uploads to ensure security.
In this post, we’ll explore how to bypass some of these mechanisms to achieve the same goal. We’ll cover common file validation methods and how they can be subverted.
Constraint
In most scenarios, the gadget file will be parsed in the front-end using JSON.parse.
It means that our file must be a valid input for JSON.parse.
If we look at the V8 implementation. A valid JSON input is :
a string
a number
true
false
null
an array
an object
