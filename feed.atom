The standout addition is the Dispatch mode, which I prefer to call reasoning mode, enabling administrators to plan complex automation tasks with AI assistance. Prompt Suggestions might better be described as big brother or creepy mode since the AI continually observes your actions and intervenes when it believes you need assistance. Additionally, AI memory functions similarly to the personalization feature in ChatGPT, allowing you to save preferences as Knowledge across sessions.

Introduction
In case you are just tuning in, Doyensec has found themselves on a
cruse ship touring the Mediterranean. Unwinding, hanging out with colleagues and having
some fun. Part 1 covered our journey into IoT ARM exploitation, while our next blog post, coming in the next couple weeks, will cover a web target. For this episode, we attempt to exploit one of the most famous vulnerabilities ever. SSHNuke from back in 2001. Better known as the exploit used by Trinity in the movie The Matrix Reloaded.



Some Quick History
Back in 1998 Ariel Futoransky and Emiliano Kargieman realized SSH’s protocol
was fundamentally flawed, as it was possible to inject cipher text. So a crc32
checksum was added in order to detect this attack.
On February 8, 2001 Michal Zalew…]]></summary>

This helps me get a sense of what subsystems are producing the most bugs at the moment in the program and also keeps me up to date on buggy patterns to look for. Also I get to shamelessly steal players’ exploitation techniques as well. A lot of recent bugs have come from /net/sched so I was looking at patches for the subsystem and found a patch that claimed an exploitable UAF was possible. That patch is here. I didn’t realize at the time, but “Lion Ackermann” mentioned in the patch as the bug discoverer (and presumably exploiter) is a kCTF player.]]></summary>

Introduction
For our last company retreat, the Doyensec team went on a cruise along the coasts of the Mediterranean Sea. As amazing as each stop was, us being geeks, we had to break the monotony of daily pool parties with some much-needed hacking sessions. Luca and John, our chiefs, came to the rescue with three challenges chosen to make us scratch our heads to get to a solution. The goal of each challenge was to analyze a real-world vulnerability with no known exploits and try to make one ourselves. The vulnerabilities were of three different categories: IoT, web, and binary exploitation; so we all chose which one we wanted to deal with, split into teams, and started working on it.
The name of this whole group activity was “!exploitable”. For those of you …]]></summary>

Roo Code (formerly Roo Cline) is a Cline fork that provides extra valuable features for the AI-enhanced IT pro. Roo Code remains comparable, and the insights I shared about working with MCP servers in Cline also apply to Roo Code. The main difference is that Roo Code serves system administrators more effectively, as it provides a mode more suitable for natural language use in a CLI. Additionally, Roo Code's support of VS Code's Code Actions feature makes it perfect for understanding and modifying a colleague's scripts.
