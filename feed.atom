        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Certificate-based authentication is an extremely robust and secure mechanism for validating a user's identity. However, until recently, you had to deploy Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) to make it available for Azure AD. Microsoft has recently introduced an Azure AD certificate-based authentication service (Azure CBA), which significantly simplifies implementing certificate-based authentication.

Lesson 2 - Least Privilege
No one should have administrative access. All elevated access should be checked out when you need it and checked back in (automatically if possible). Just like UAC. MFA should be required, proximity or push based. And every use of a break glass account should be highly monitored

I think “Least Privilege” has been harped on at least … you know what, let me wager that you can’t find a single infosec or hacking conference from 2000 until now (2022) that doesn’t have 4 talks with the words “least privilege” in the talk. But maybe a handful out of all of those talks tell you how to accomplish such a feat.

Lesson 11
Lesson 1 - YOU could be “Legacy”
Stop thinking that just because it did or didn’t work X way when you learned it, it still does or doesn’t. That could be 20 years ago. Technology changes faster than you do.

I guess that’s a bit mean for a title but here’s the thing:
One of the greatest yet most challenging things about doing any job in technology is staying current. Everyone struggles to stay up to date with as much of what is going on around you. Many people specialize, which makes it easier to stay up to date with a specific thing. Yet that can lead to tunnel vision as well.
All I’m trying to say here is that sometimes, the person with the least amount of “experience” in a given technology field is going to have the most open mind to what is possible. No matter how long you have been in cyber security or technology in general, you should consider your knowledge on a specific topic a point in time piece of information. At that exact moment in your life, that fact was true. This doesn’t mean that it stays that way.
Take passwords for example. Everyone said “8 character passwords are secure” for decades. I’m still hearing that. Or “never write your passwords down”. This is just one example. “Never use X software, it’s insecure”, is it still?. One of the ways I stay “current” is by always challenging my knowledge of how I think things should work vs how they do.
This is why during my keynote I noted when and where I leaned these lessons, there is every possibility I am complete off base with all of them. This is also why it’s my beautiful basics lesson #1. Something to always keep top of mind.]]></summary>

We would love to have you! However, there are a few things you should know before we get started. With Pwn2Own Vancouver just around the corner, here are 10 things you need to know before participating in Pwn2Own.
1.     You need to register before the contest. 
We try to make this as apparent as possible in the rules, but we still have people walk into the room on the first day of the contest hoping to participate. There are a lot of logistics around Pwn2Own, so we need everyone to complete their registration before the contest starts. We can’t support anyone who wants to join on the first day of the competition.

After setting up Exchange Server 2019, you might be unaware that it's possible to send mail anonymously to internal recipients by default. This means that, using PowerShell, for example, anyone in your LAN may send messages to internal accounts without revealing their identity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I keynoted @BSidesVancouver. It was an honor to be asked and I had a great time.
Conference Link: https://hopin.com/events/bsides-vancouver-2022/
I talked about 11 lessons learned over my career that contradict some of the edicts that are well known in the Cyber Security space.
Before we get into the lessons though, let me attack the things I know many of you reading this already have queued up in your head.

Counter Point 1
“All of that is well and good, but it’ll never work where I work.”
Why not? Every single one of these lessons learned are things that I was told wasn’t possible. For the most part they were things I didn’t even do, they were things either already in place when I joined the company or put into place while I worked there.
I saw first hand that something I was told was “impossible” was not only possible but accomplished much more than I could have imagined. Until you see something for yourself, it’s hard to go against what you are taught, but as Security Professionals isn’t that what we are supposed to do? Look beyond the scope of what is seen as “possible”?
Counter Point 2
“It’s not as easy as you are making it sound.”
You are right, none of this is easy. Good work hardly ever is. If you are looking for the easy solution, something that can be done in a day or a week this is not the blog series for you.
Counter Point 3
“We already known all of this”
Awesome! I wish I would have known these things earlier in my career.
