This blog post details preparatory steps to speed up the attack, hopefully considerably.
Electromagnetic fault injection
In general, fault injection attacks against hardware attempt to produce some sort of gain for an attacker by injecting faults into a device under attack by manipulating clock pulses, supply voltages, temperature, electromagnetic fields around the device, and aiming short light pulses at certain locations on the device. Of these vectors, EMFI s…]]></summary>

He used this bug as a part of his winning exploit that led to code execution in the renderer of both browsers. This bug was quickly patched by both Google and Microsoft. Manfred has graciously provided this detailed write-up of the vulnerability and how he exploited it at the contest.
In this blog, I describe a means of exploiting the V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine to gain execution of arbitrary shellcode inside the renderer process. This includes a bypass of the V8 memory sandbox (Ubercage), though code execution is still constrained by the process isolation-based browser sandbox. For demonstration purposes, this …]]></summary>

We’ve decided to publish our thoughts on this topic to clarify it for those who might still be unsure.



Defining the approaches
Product Security Audit
What we refer to as a product security audit is a time-bound project, where one or more engineers focus on a particular application exclusively. The testing is performed by employees of an application security firm. This work is usually scoped ahead of time and billed at flat hourly/daily rates, with the total cos…]]></summary>

By inducing authentication through DCOM it can be relayed to a network service, such as Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) to elevated privileges and in some cases get domain administrator access.
The important difference with this new research is taking the abuse of DCOM authentication from local access (in the case of the many Potatoes) to fully remote by abusing security configuration changes or over granting group access. For more information I'd recommend reading the slides from Tianze Ding Blackhat ASIA 2024 presentation, or reading about SilverPotato by Andrea Pierini.
