Aleandro
During my last high school year I took part in the Cyberchallenge.it program, whose goal is to introduce young students to the world of offensive cybersecurity, via lessons and CTFs competitions. After that experience, some friends and I founded the r00tstici CTF team, attempting to bring some cybersecurity culture to the south of Italy. We also organized various workshops and events at the University of Salento.
Once I moved from south of Italy to Pisa, to study at the university, I joined the fibonhack CTF team. I then also started working as a developer and penetration tester on small projects, both inside the university and outside.

We saw some amazing research yesterday, including a Tesla exploit and a single exploit hitting both Chrome and Edge. So far, we have paid out $723,500 for the event, and we’re poised to hit $1,000,000 again. Today looks to be just as exciting with more attempts in virtualization, browser sandbox escapes, and the Pwn2Own’s first ever Docker escape, so stay tuned for all of the results! 
SUCCESS - Marcin Wiązowski used an improper input validation bug to escalate privileges on Windows 11. He earns $15,000 and 3 Master of Pwn points. 
SUCCESS - STAR Labs SG's exploit of VMware Workstation used two bugs. One is an uninitialized variable, but the other was previously known. They still win $30,000 and 6 Master of Pwn points.
