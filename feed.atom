        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today at the Black Hat USA conference, we announced some new disclosure timelines. Our standard 120-day disclosure timeline for most vulnerabilities remains, but for bug reports that result from faulty or incomplete patches, we will use a shorter timeline. Moving forward, the ZDI will adopt a tiered approach based on the severity of the bug and the efficacy of the original fix. The first tier will be a 30-day timeframe for most Critical-rated cases where exploitation is detected or expected. The second level will be a 60-day interval for Critical- and High-severity bugs where the patch offers some protections. Finally, there will be a 90-day period for other severities where no imminent exploitation is expected. As with our normal timelines, extensions will be limited and granted on a case…]]></summary>

Some were also found to be exploited in the wild. Since these bugs were found in ESXi’s implementation of the SLP service, VMware provided workarounds to turn off the service. VMware also disabled the service by default starting with ESX 7.0 Update 2c. In this blog post, we explore another remotely reachable attack surface: ESXi’s TCP/IP stack implemented as a VMkernel module. The most interesting outcome of this analysis is that ESXi’s TCP/IP stack is based on FreeBSD 8.2 and does not include security patches for the vulnerabilities disclosed over the years since that release of FreeBSD. 
This result also prompted us to analyze the nature of vulnerabilities di…]]></summary>
