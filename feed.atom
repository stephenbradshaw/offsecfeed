This blog introduces my thinking processes and practical methods for
instrumenting client side JavaScript. This processes have helped me to find
deeply embedded bugs in complicated codebases with relative ease. I have been

Introduction

In December 2022, Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) discovered an in-the-wild exploit chain targeting Samsung Android devices. TAG’s blog post covers the targeting and the actor behind the campaign. This is a technical analysis of the final stage of one of the exploit chains, specifically CVE-2023-0266 (a 0-day in the ALSA compatibility layer) and CVE-2023-26083 (a 0-day in the Mali GPU driver) as well as the techniques used by the attacker to gain kernel arbitrary read/write access.

Notably, all of the previous stages of the exploit chain used n-day vulnerabilities:


CVE-2022-4262, a vulnerability patched in Chrome that was unpatched in the Samsung browser (i.e. a "Chrome n-day"), was used to achieve RCE.


CVE-2022-3038, another Chrome n-…]]></summary>
