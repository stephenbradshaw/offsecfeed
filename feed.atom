This post will explain how to access the AI models through the Bedrock API from third-party apps like VS Code or Cursor. Specifically, when using AI models like Claude Sonnet 3.5 for coding, accessing it through Amazon Bedrock offers enhanced security compared to Anthropic or model hub APIs such as OpenRouter.

Introduction
For our last company retreat, the Doyensec team went on a cruise along the coasts of the Mediterranean Sea. As amazing as each stop was, us being geeks, we had to break the monotony of daily pool parties with some much-needed hacking sessions. Luca and John, our chiefs, came to the rescue with three challenges chosen to make us scratch our heads to get to a solution. The goal of each challenge was to analyze a real-world vulnerability with no known exploits and try to make one ourselves. The vulnerabilities were of three different categories: IoT, web, and binary exploitation; so we all chose which one we wanted to deal with, split into teams, and started working on it.
The name of this whole group activity was “!exploitable”. For those of you …]]></summary>

Roo Code (formerly Roo Cline) is a Cline fork that provides extra valuable features for the AI-enhanced IT pro. Roo Code remains comparable, and the insights I shared about working with MCP servers in Cline also apply to Roo Code. The main difference is that Roo Code serves system administrators more effectively, as it provides a mode more suitable for natural language use in a CLI. Additionally, Roo Code's support of VS Code's Code Actions feature makes it perfect for understanding and modifying a colleague's scripts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my previous posts, I introduced Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) and explained how to install an MCP server for the Claude Desktop app. Today, I show you something more relevant for admins. My introductory article about Cline mentioned that the VS Code extension supports MCP. You will see that installing an MCP server is easier with the assistance of an AI. In this post, I will explain how to install AWS MCP, an MCP server that allows you to manage AWS resources with the help of an AI. If you don't want to be left behind, I highly recommend getting started with learning how to use AI to get your job done. This tech revolution is advancing faster than any before it. And we are only at the very beginning.

In today's article, I will illustrate the MCP concept by installing MCP Server Fetch, which allows the Claude desktop app to retrieve webpages and convert them to Markdown. I believe that managing MCP servers will likely be one of the main tasks for AI ops admins.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This blog post was co-authored by Matteo Malvica (Researcher at OffSec and External OST developer) and Cedric Van Bockhaven (OST developer and researcher at Outflank).
This article is the first in a two-part series in which we investigate the anatomy of Virtualization-Based Security (VBS) enclaves, their internals, and the unique ways they could be leveraged for offensive operations on Windows systems.
Enclaves provide a software-based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and are isolated memory regions. Only code that runs within the enclave can access data within the same enclave. TEEs protect sensitive operations in computing and are designed to keep unauthorized actors away from confidential information, whether that actor is malware with user-mode or kernel-mode access or even someone with physical access to the data center.
You can imagine that being able to hide away data and code into an enclave is a powerful capability and could also be used for offensive purposes,

It enables AI agents to make informed decisions to perform tasks autonomously. Given that Anthropic's announcement is just a few weeks old, the number of available MCP servers is impressive.

While it simplifies user login, its complexity can lead to misconfigurations that create security holes. Some of the more intricate vulnerabilities keep reappearing because the protocol’s inner workings are not always well-understood. In an effort to change that, we have decided to write a comprehensive guide on known attacks against OAuth implementations. Additionally, we have created a comprehensive checklist.
