Whether you’re debugging, trying to see a process crash, or trying to write an exploit, it can be super duper annoying! In a few days, I’m giving a talk at NorthSec in Montreal. I asked some co-workers to review my slides, and they commented that I have some neat techniques to deal with forking, so I thought I’d share a couple!

AWS Lambda, as a service, has always been popular, with its simple process of uploading code and not having to worry about provisioning servers. However, you might be a company that is invested in container technology, and it is not so easy to utilize Lambda. With the support for Lambda functions with container images, you can now enjoy this functionality.

Furthermore, Microsoft is trying to battle macro malware by enforcing Mark-of-the-Web (MotW) control on macro-enabled documents. In this blog we will dive into some of the quirks of Microsoft Office macro security, various commonly used configuration options and their bypasses.
In the first part of the blog we will discuss various Microsoft Office security controls on macros and add-ins, including their subtleties, pitfalls and offensive bypasses. 
In the second part of this blog the concept of LOLdocs is further explained, detailing how vulnerabilities in signed MS Office content might be abused to bypass even strictly configured MS Office installs.
This blog is related to our BruCON talk on LOLdocs: legitimately signed Office documents where control flows can be hijacked for malicious purposes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) threat-hunting team observed new exploit attempts coming from our telemetry system in Eastern Europe indicating that the Mirai botnet has updated its arsenal to include CVE-2023-1389, also known as ZDI-CAN-19557/ZDI-23-451. This bug in the TP-Link Archer AX21 Wi-Fi router was originally disclosed to ZDI during the Pwn2Own Toronto event, where it was used by Team Viettel in their LAN-side entry against the TP-Link device and by Qrious Security in their WAN-side entry.  
Both teams’ entries were successful at the contest, and the vulnerabilities were disclosed to the vendor. Interestingly, the bug was also used by the Tenable team in their unsuccessful Pwn2Own attempt against the device. They, too, disclosed the bug to TP-Link, but their public report…]]></summary>

The risks of detection outweigh the need for having an implant “parasiting” in a host process. Typical process injection techniques stand out too much and more often than not is the injection linked to malicious activity.

However, if you are using this in a URL, it’s pretty hard to do anything too complicated since it expands the text to the point where web servers won’t accept the URL anymore (8190 characters is default max in Apache).
So I used this:
<?=`$_GET[0]`?>

From: https://github.com/bayufedra/Tiny-PHP-Webshell
Which resulted in the following 3036 character URI ending in a &0=ls which executed the command ls:
