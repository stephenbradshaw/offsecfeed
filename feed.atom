        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reading NTFS permissions for files and folders on a Windows device to find misconfiguration can be a cumbersome and time-consuming task. Basically, there are two options for accomplishing the task. Either you can read NTFS permissions for every scanned object and analyze the results, or you can find misconfigured permissions and list only the differences. Let me show you how to do the latter with the help of AccessEnum, a GUI tool from the Sysinternals Suite.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this blog post we will demonstrate how compiling, reverse engineering or even just viewing source code can lead to compromise of a developer’s workstation. This research is especially relevant in the context of attacks on security researchers using backdoored Visual Studio projects allegedly by North Korean actors, as exposed by Google. We will show that these in-the-wild attacks are only the tip of the iceberg and that backdoors can be hidden via much stealthier vectors in Visual Studio projects.
This post will be a journey into COM, type libraries and the inner workings of Visual Studio. In particular, it serves the following goals:
Exploring Visual Studio’s attack surface for initial access attacks from a red teamer’s perspective.
Raising awareness on the dangers of working with untrusted code, which we as hackers and security researchers do on a regular basis.

A large number of today’s crypto scams involve some sort of phishing attack, where the user is tricked into visiting a shady/malicious web site and connecting their wallet to it. The main goal is to trick the user into signing a transaction which will ultimately give the attacker control over the user’s tokens.
Usually, it all starts with a tweet or a post on some Telegram group or Slack channel, where a link is sent advertising either a new yield farming protocol boasting large APYs, or a new NFT project which just started minting. In order to interact with the web site, the user would need to connect their wallet and perform some confirmation or authorization steps.

With the advent of new technologies and a rapidly evolving threat landscape, defending against cyber attacks has become more challenging than ever before. We recently presented on the evolution of software security threats and defense strategies at the Security Summit in Milan on 15th March 2023. In this blog post, we'll explore some of the key takeaways from the presentation.
In the early 1990s, the Internet was still in its infancy, and most people accessed it through their workstations or personal computers. Security threats were relatively simple, and malware and viruses were typically spread through floppy disks or infected email attachments.

Introduction
Server Side Request Forgery is a vulnerability in which a malicious actor exploits a victim server to perform HTTP(S) requests on the attacker’s behalf.
