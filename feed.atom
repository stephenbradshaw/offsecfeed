In 2022, we joined forces with Fortra and we can hardly believe it’s been over a year already. It was a big decision to go from being a small team of red teamers to becoming part of a large company, but we’re very pleased with the switch. In this reflection on the past 12 months, we want to provide an update on our mission, detail our continued dedication to OST, discuss the process of growing the Outflank community, and touch on where we’re headed next.  
A Product Oriented Focus
One of our biggest challenges when we joined Fortra was the decision to put most of our energy into Outflank Security Tooling (OST).
