Autel has been informed and has deployed a firmware update (v1.35) to address both of these issues. If you want to read about other Autel bugs reported at Pwn2Own, you check out our earlier blog here.
The First Vulnerability: CVE-2024-23967 (ZDI-CAN-23230)
Researchers from Computest Sector 7 identified and exploited a stack-based buffer overflow in v1.32 of the Autel firmware. This vulnerability stems from the decoding of base64 encoded data that can be controlled by an attacker. The encoded data is decoded into a fixed-size stack buffer with no bounds checks, leading to a stack buffer overflow and remote code execution.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
In this post, we are going to explore a rarely discussed class of vulnerabilities in Ruby, known as class pollution. This concept is inspired by the idea of prototype pollution in JavaScript, where recursive merges are exploited to poison the prototype of objects, leading to unexpected behaviors. This idea was initially discussed in a blog post about prototype pollution in Python, in which the researcher used recursive merging to poison class variables and eventually global variables via the __globals__ attribute.
In Ruby, we can categorize class pollution into three main cases:
Merge on Hashes: In this scenario, class pollution isn’t possible because the merge operation is confined to the hash itself.
Merge on Attributes (Non-Recursive): Here, we can poison the instance varia…]]></summary>

In this article, part 3 of the series, I describe a chain of 3 vulnerabilities that led to remote code execution:
·       CVE-2023-36744 – Arbitrary File Write vulnerability
·       CVE-2023-36777 – Arbitrary File Read vulnerability
·       CVE-2023-36745 – Local DLL Loading vulnerability
In the sections that follow, I’m going to describe each of these in detail and show how I chained them to eventually achieve RCE.

Recently Doyensec was hired by a client offering a “Communication Platform as a Service”. This platform allows their clients to craft a customer service experience and to communicate with their own customers via a plethora of channels: email, web chats, social media and more.

While such threats cannot be fully eliminated, it is possible to minimize the possibilities for exploitation. Recognizing this, Doyensec was hired to performed a security review, specifically focused on social enginee…]]></summary>

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) serves this purpose by connecting to data sources outside the trained language model.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By Joe Doyle If you’ve encountered cryptography software, you’ve probably heard the advice to never use a nonce twice—in fact, that’s where the word nonce (number used once) comes from. Depending on the cryptography involved, a reused nonce can reveal encrypted messages, or even leak your secret key! But common knowledge may not cover every […]]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NVIDIA's quasi-monopoly in the AI GPU market is achieved through its CUDA platform's early development and widespread adoption. It serves as a moat by becoming the industry standard due to its superior performance and integration with key AI tools. While NVIDIA's dominance is bolstered by its proprietary advantages and developer lock-in, emerging competitors like AMD and innovations such as AMD's ROCm, OpenAI's Triton, and PyTorch 2.0 are beginning to challenge this stronghold by offering open-source alternatives and reducing reliance on CUDA.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As you may know, I recently presented my Exchange-related talk during OffensiveCon 2024. This series of 4 blog posts is meant to supplement the talk and provide additional technical details. You can read the first post in this series here.
In part 2, I describe the ApprovedApplicationCollection gadget, which was available for abuse because it did not appear on the deny list and could therefore be accessed via MultiValuedProperty. I am also presenting a path traversal in the Windows utility extrac32.exe, which allowed me to complete the chain for a full RCE in Exchange. For the moment, at least, Microsoft has made a decision not to fix this path traversal bug.
