The resulting functional flows are characterized by multiple state-changing steps with complex trust boundaries and responsibility separation among the involved actors.
In such situations, web security specialists have to manually model sequence diagrams if they want to support their analysis with visualizations of the whole functionality logic.

·       It allows you to gain Remote Code Execution on two hosts at the same time: the client where the malicious project file is initially loaded, as well as the server that ultimately handles the file.

Solution
The challenge for the data-import CloudSecTidbit is basically reading the content of an internal bucket. The frontend web application is using the targeted bucket to store the logo of the app.
The name of the bucket is returned to the client by calling the /variable endpoint:

$.ajax({
    type: 'GET',
    url: '/variable',
    dataType: 'json',
    success: function (data) {
        let source_internal = `https://${data}.s3.amazonaws.com/public-stuff/logo.png?${Math.random()}`;
        $(".logo_image").attr("src", source_internal);
    },
    error: function (jqXHR, status, err) {
        alert("Error getting variable name");
    }
});

The first public information appeared on July 12 with the release of the patch for CVE-2022-22047, which was being actively exploited. Shortly thereafter, Microsoft published an article providing some technical details and revealing that the threat actor involved was an Austrian hack-for-hire group tracked by Microsoft as KNOTWEED. Fortuitously, these developments coincided with closely related research I had been conducting, and in that same month, I reported to Microsoft two additional vulnerabilities affecting the same component.

This bug was originally reported to the ZDI program by a researcher known as rgod. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory corruption condition.
