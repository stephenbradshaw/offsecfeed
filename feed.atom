Despite last-minute patches from many vendors, we have plenty of attempts across multiple categories - with plenty of attempts in the new Surveillance category as well. We have more than $1,000,000 in cash and prizes available for contestants. We came close last year to exceeding the million-dollar mark, and we are fans of setting records. As always, we began our contest with a random drawing to determine the order of attempts. If you missed it, you can watch the replay here. 
The complete schedule for the contest is below (all times Eastern [GMT -4:00]).

The number of Android applications has been growing rapidly in recent years. In 2022, there were over 3.55 million Android apps available in the Google Play Store, and this number is expected to continue to grow in the years to come. The expansion of the Android app market is being driven by a number of factors, including the increasing popularity of smartphones, the growing demand for mobile apps, and the ease of developing and publishing Android apps. At the same time, the number of Android app
 downloads is also growing rapidly. In 2022, there were over 255 billion Android app downloads worldwide.

This post will teach you about Kubernetes init containers. A Kubernetes init container is a special type of container that runs before the main application container in a Pod. The init containers can be used to perform tasks such as setting up the environment, pulling code or a binary from a repository, downloading dependencies, or running scripts that are not part of the container image. You can use an init container to wait for other services, such as a database, to come up before the main app container starts. Essentially, init containers are used to get things ready for your app containers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Windows, named pipes are a form of interprocess communication (IPC) that allows processes to communicate with one another, both locally and across the network. Named pipes serve as a mechanism to transfer data between Windows components as well as third-party applications and services. Both locally as well as on a domain. From an offensive perspective, named pipes may leak some information that could be useful for reconnaissance purposes. Since named pipes can also be used (depending on configuration) to access services remotely – they could allow remote exploits (MS08-067).
In this post we will explore how named pipes can be listed remotely in offensive operations, for example via an implant running on a compromised Windows system.

In this post, we look at the attack surface of another target in a different category. The Sony XAV-AX5500 is a popular aftermarket head unit that interacts with different systems within a vehicle. It also offers attackers a potential foothold into an automobile.
The Sony XAV-AX5500 is an aftermarket vehicle head unit. This head unit supports many technologies that encompass its attack surface. This post endeavors to introduce the Sony XAV-AX5500, describe the relevant technologies in the head unit, and identify the attack surface present in the device.

Direct system calls (syscalls), Indirect syscalls, unhooking, hardware breakpoints, and bringing and loading your own version of a library. These methods each have advantages and disadvantages. When developing a C2 implant it’s nice to work with a combination of multiple of these. For instance, you could use a strong (in)direct syscall library for direct usermode to kernel transition, then use unhooking or hardware breakpoints for user mode-only (to bypass AMSI, ETW e.g.) functions.
Regarding system calls, excellent research has already been done. A small selection of relevant blog posts is Klezvirus’ post on syswhispers, MDSec’s post on direct invocation of system calls and our own blog post on combining direct system calls srdi.
