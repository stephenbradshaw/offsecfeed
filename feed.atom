This bug was originally discovered and reported by ZDI Vulnerability Research Piotr Bazydło. The vulnerability results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in the deserialization of untrusted data. An authenticated attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of SYSTEM. The following is a portion of their write-up covering CVE-2022-38108, with a few minimal modifications.

In the wild, there can be several scenarios that an attacker may encounter when attempting to escalate from AFW to RCE in web applications. These can generically be categorized as:
