With recent high-profile attacks, including that against the Colonial Pipeline in March 2021, it has become clear that the organizations handling critical infrastructure networks are now in the firing line.

I want to show how sometimes just manually poking around can quickly uncover vulnerabilities you might miss with other approaches to vulnerability discovery. 
In my previous blog, I highlighted a tool named IO Ninja and shared why it is helpful when working with Inter-Process Communications (IPC). In this blog, I would like to show you how this tool helped me find two vulnerabilities: CVE-2021-4198 and CVE-2021-4199 in Bitdefender’s antivirus software on Windows. The exploit I wrote targets a named pipe used by the Vulnerability.scan.exe process. The first vulnerability results in a denial-of-service on almost any process within the AV.

Go buy a Thinkst Canary, they detect me more than any multi-million dollar EDR. Period.

Let me clarify something quickly before I get roasted. I am not saying that EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) agents don’t have a place, it’s just that they have taken over for Anti-Virus for being mostly preventative and response oriented. Do EDRs detect things? Sure, but in my pentesting and red teaming experience they rarely catch any of the actions I do outside of touching LSASS. Which to be fair, is what a lot of malware and APT actors do. But it won’t stay that way, and Sysmon is f…]]></summary>

The problem I found with these articles and many like it didn’t really offer any sort of method to protect yourself or you company from ISO mounted malware, so I went to try to find a solution myself (couldn’t be that hard right?). Turns out that if you google for “Stop Windows from Mounting ISOs” or something similar you get a bunch of MSDN articles for people trying to solve the same issue for one reason or another.

If you want to find Active Directory LDAP servers, use the following command:
$ dig -t SRV _ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.sittingduck.info
