At Doyensec, we decided to perform a vulnerability research activity on the SMB3 Kernel Server (ksmbd), a component of the Linux kernel. Initially, it was enabled as an experimental feature, but in the kernel version 6.6, the experimental flag was removed, and it remains stable.
Ksmbd splits tasks to optimize performance, handling critical file operations in kernel space and non-performance-related tasks, such as DCE/RPC and user account management, in user space via ksmbd.mountd. The server uses a multi-threaded architecture to efficiently process SMB requests in parallel, leveraging kernel worker threads for scalability and user-space integration for configuration and RPC handling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent paper, Google researchers discussed an interesting approach that reduces training time and computational cost while improving the quality of Large Language Models (LLMs). The SALT (Small Model Aided Large Model Training) method uses smaller models to guide the initial training phase of larger models through knowledge distillation (KD). SALTDS (SALT with Data Selection) extends this technique by identifying and prioritizing challenging but learnable training sequences for knowledge transfer during the KD phase.
