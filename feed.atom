This post will teach you about Kubernetes init containers. A Kubernetes init container is a special type of container that runs before the main application container in a Pod. The init containers can be used to perform tasks such as setting up the environment, pulling code or a binary from a repository, downloading dependencies, or running scripts that are not part of the container image. You can use an init container to wait for other services, such as a database, to come up before the main app container starts. Essentially, init containers are used to get things ready for your app containers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Windows, named pipes are a form of interprocess communication (IPC) that allows processes to communicate with one another, both locally and across the network. Named pipes serve as a mechanism to transfer data between Windows components as well as third-party applications and services. Both locally as well as on a domain. From an offensive perspective, named pipes may leak some information that could be useful for reconnaissance purposes. Since named pipes can also be used (depending on configuration) to access services remotely – they could allow remote exploits (MS08-067).
In this post we will explore how named pipes can be listed remotely in offensive operations, for example via an implant running on a compromised Windows system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In May 2023, we received a vulnerability report from an anonymous researcher regarding a vulnerability in Apple Safari. It turned out to be an interesting classic integer underflow vulnerability. Apple assigned CVE-2023-38600 to this issue and fixed it in the following security advisories:
— iOS 16.6 and iPadOS 16.6 
— macOS Ventura 13.5 
— tvOS 16.6
— Safari 16.6 
— watchOS 9.6 
 Now that this vulnerability has been addressed by the vendor, we are ready to share additional details with the community.

Both features work together in the Kubernetes ecosystem to facilitate the automatic scaling of pods based on observed system or custom metrics. A HorizontalPodAutoscaler automatically scales the number of Pods in a workload resource (such as a Deployment or a StatefulSet) based on observed metrics, such as CPU or memory utilization. It helps to improve the performance and efficiency of the application by adjusting the number of Pods to match the current demand.

In this post, we look at the attack surface of another target in a different category. The Sony XAV-AX5500 is a popular aftermarket head unit that interacts with different systems within a vehicle. It also offers attackers a potential foothold into an automobile.
The Sony XAV-AX5500 is an aftermarket vehicle head unit. This head unit supports many technologies that encompass its attack surface. This post endeavors to introduce the Sony XAV-AX5500, describe the relevant technologies in the head unit, and identify the attack surface present in the device.

Direct system calls (syscalls), Indirect syscalls, unhooking, hardware breakpoints, and bringing and loading your own version of a library. These methods each have advantages and disadvantages. When developing a C2 implant it’s nice to work with a combination of multiple of these. For instance, you could use a strong (in)direct syscall library for direct usermode to kernel transition, then use unhooking or hardware breakpoints for user mode-only (to bypass AMSI, ETW e.g.) functions.
Regarding system calls, excellent research has already been done. A small selection of relevant blog posts is Klezvirus’ post on syswhispers, MDSec’s post on direct invocation of system calls and our own blog post on combining direct system calls srdi.
